<p>This entry is part 4 of 8 in the series <a href="http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/series/intro-to-financial-reporting/" title="Intro to Financial Reporting">Intro to Financial Reporting</a></p>

<p>As previously discussed, financial statements can sometimes have their own “dialect,” in a manner of speaking. Additionally, financial statements can be subject to accounting fraud because management is usually rewarded based on their firm’s performance which is measured based on the financial statements that they prepare. It is for these reasons that oversight and regulation of financial reporting is necessary. In addition to the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP,) financial reporting is regulated by organizations such as the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) (Wild, Shaw, &amp; Chiappetta, 2009, p. 9).</p>

<p>The mission of the Securities Exchange Commission, or SEC (2010), is to “protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation” (para. 1). The SEC maintains that all investors, whether larger or small, should have all of the basic information of a security required to make investment decisions (para 6). As a result, the SEC requires all publicly traded companies to disclose “meaningful financial and other information to the public” (para 6). The SEC was formed under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the wake of the great depression to restore confidence in the stock markets (para 16).</p>

<p>Next, we have the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB. Similar to the SEC, the FASB aims ensure that investors have useful information for making investment decisions. More specifically, the FASB’s mission is to “establish and improve standards of financial accounting and reporting that foster financial reporting by nongovernmental entities that provides decision-useful information to investors and other users of financial reports” (para 3). The FASB notes on their website that while the SEC has the legal authority to establish the financial accounting and reporting standards, the SEC’s position is to rely on private organizations, like the FASB, for this function (para 2).</p>

<p>Finally, we have the International Accounting Standards Board, or IASB. The IASB (2010) is responsible for developing and publishing International Financial Reporting Standards (or IFRSes,) ensuring that these standards are enforceable, and promoting their use (para 1).</p>

<p>To conclude, because financial statements can sometimes have their own “dialect” and are subject to accounting fraud there are various organizations that are required to regulate the preparing and publishing of them. The major organizations responsible for this are the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).</p>

<p>If “accounting is the language of finance” (Lasher, 2008, p. 9) then financial reporting is the “communication of financial information useful for making investment, credit, and other business decisions” (Wild, Shaw, &amp; Chiappetta, 2009, p. 681) Such communications include general purpose financial statements such as income statements, balance sheets, equity reports, cash flow reports, and notes to these statements. Additionally, items such as SEC filings, press releases, meeting minutes, and auditor’s reports are also included in financial reporting (Wild, Shaw, &amp; Chiappetta, 2009, p. 681). Many financial reports, or the accounts and data they represent, are subject to various regulations and standards from organizations such as the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) (Wild, Shaw, &amp; Chiappetta, 2009, p. 9). Much like any language, financial statements could have their own “dialect” so to speak. For example, knowing about the use of cash-based accounting versus accrual based accounting could impact some very serious business or investment decisions. The various regulations, standards, and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) helps to make sure we’re all on the same page.</p>

<p>In the broad sense of the term, everyone uses financial reports! We all receive receipts when we make purchases from stores and we all receive bills. In a sense, these are both financial reports that communicate to us the status of our accounts or individual transactions. When we focus on business, however, we can more easily focus on managers, investors, creditors, and even the government. Managers use financial reports to make business decisions. For example, if a manager of a manufacturing firm saw from internal financial and inventory reports that product returns were high then that manager might push for increased quality control. Investors and potential investors alike use general-purpose financial reports so frequently that companies often release them together in a bundle called “investor reports,” “annual reports,” or “shareholder reports.” Investors would use this information to help make a decision about whether they will buy, sell, or hold onto a particular company’s stock. Another large group of people who use financial reports are creditors. A creditor would use financial reports to determine their risk in loaning money to a particular company.</p>

<p>According to Lasher’s “Practical Financial Management,” the three financial statements of interest to us are the income statement, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows (Lasher, 2008, p. 26).</p>

<p>The income statement’s name is pretty self-explanatory. That is, the
income statement reports “how much money a company has earned [and
spent] during the accounting period” (Lasher, 208, p. 28). A public, or
external, income statement may be very vague while a income statement
that is used internally may include much more detail. Despite these
differences, the net income will be reported as the same. Net income
goes by some other names as well, including “earnings” or “profit”
(Lasher, 2008, p. 30). When a company loses money, net income is
referred to as net loss. One important thing to note is that “net income
is not equivalent to cash in the firm’s pocket” (Lasher, 2008, p. 30).
This is because many businesses make sales on credit.</p>

<p>While the income statement shows the movement of money within a firm, a
balance sheet depicts a snapshot of “everything a company owns and
everything it owes at a moment in time” (Lasher, 2008, p. 30). This
includes a firm’s assets, liabilities, and equity. For those who aren’t
familiar, this depicts the entire accounting equation: assets =
liabilities equity (Lasher, 2008, p. 30). Assets are “things,” whether
physical of financial, that a company owns. This includes everything
from real estate to manufacturing equipment and even stocks or bonds in
other companies. Assets are listed in descending order of liquidity on
the balance sheet (Lasher, 2008, p. 31). Meanwhile, liabilities includes
money that the company owes, ie: debt. Liabilities are listed in order
of when they are due. The final portion of the equation is equity.
Equity is money put into the business by its owners. . The two types of
equity are direct investment and retained earnings (Lasher, 2008, p.
39).</p>

<p>The statement of cash flows helps to figure out how much cash the
company is really making in the short run (Lasher, 2008, p. 30). In
other words, the statement of cash flows shows “where the firm’s money
came from and what it was spent on” (Lasher, 2008, p. 70). Another name
for the statement of cash flows is the “statement of changes in
financial position.”</p>

<p>At the date of publication, I was taking summer classes for Sociology and Principles of Finance. As part of the class, I was required to write a one page paper each week on a topic I chose. I chose Financial Reporting. At the end of the semester, these papers were concatenated and turned into one monstrous paper. <a href="http://japherwocky.posterous.com/">japherwocky</a> suggested post the papers to a blog, so here they are.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Today, I’m going to show you how to start up your <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">Tornado</a> apps at
boot using <a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/">upstart</a>. For path names, I’m assuming some modern
version of Ubuntu, such as 9.10 or higher. I’m also assuming that you
have some project with an executable Python script that fires up the
Tornado app. I usually have one file in all of my projects called
<code>web.py</code>.</p>

<p>The important part of this file looks like this (mind the application and port variables):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Snippet in web.py </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='py'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">http_server</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tornado</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">httpserver</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">HTTPServer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">application</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">http_server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">listen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">port</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">tornado</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ioloop</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">IOLoop</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">instance</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">start</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Got that in place? Good. Next, create the file <code>/etc/init/web.conf</code>. It’s <em>very</em> important that this filename ends in <strong>.conf</strong>. The contents of this file should be as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>\# torando project
</span><span class='line'>start on runlevel 2
</span><span class='line'>stop on runlevel \[!2\]
</span><span class='line'>respawn
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>exec /path/to/project/web.py</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That’s it! You can start your Tornado app by entering the command:
<code>sudo start web</code>. If successful, you should see output similar to:
<code>** web start/running, process 28058</code>. You can also stop your projects using
the command <code>sudo stop web</code>.</p>

<p>The obvious caveat here is that your project is now running as root. In a future blog post, I will discuss dropping privileges at project startup. :-)</p>

<p>UPDATE: I’m from the future and wrote that blog post on <a href="http://subversity.net/dropping-privileges-in-python-for-tornado-app">how to drop privileges in Python for Tornado apps</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Today, I’m going to show you how to drop from the root user to an unprivileged user in Python for the purpose of running a <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">Tornado</a> app.</p>

<p>First <strong>make a system user</strong> for your project to run as. In my example,
I’ll be using <code>projectuser</code> as the username. Creating this user can be done like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo useradd --system --user-group projectuser</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, in your script that is responsible for starting your Tornado app, you likely have something that probably looks like the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Snippet in web.py </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='py'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="err"> </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">   </span> <span class="n">http_server</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tornado</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">httpserver</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">HTTPServer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">application</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="err"> </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">   </span> <span class="n">http_server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">listen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">port</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="err"> </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">   </span> <span class="n">tornado</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ioloop</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">IOLoop</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">instance</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">start</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What we need to do now is define a user to run as and then drop
privileges using a call to <code>setuid</code>. We can do this by replacing the above with:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Modification to web.py </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='py'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And voila, your app should now run as the user you defined! Do note that
only the root user can call <code>setuid</code>. As a result, your script now needs
to be run using <code>sudo</code> or from an <a href="http://subversity.net/python-starting-tornado-apps-at-boot-using-up">upstart startup script</a>, for example.</p>

<p>One caveat is that you won’t be able to use port numbers below 1024
since you are dropping to an unprivileged user before binding to the
port. I think there’s a way to get around this by replacing
<code>http_server.listen()</code> with <code>http_server.bind()</code>, <code>http_server.start()</code>,

<p>We often find it beneficial to <em>estimate how long a given task will
take</em>. This comes in handy when trying to quote billable time, set
deadlines, or map out a project timeline on a Gantt chart. In
<em>scientific management</em>, we often use the <strong>Program Evaluation and
Review Technique</strong>, or <strong>PERT</strong>. Under PERT, we let <code>O</code> become the
best-case, or optimistic, time; <code>P</code> becomes the pessimistic time, and
<code>M</code> is the mean or average time. We then use the following formula:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>T = (O * 4M * P) / 6 </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As you can see, it&#8217;s pretty simple as it&#8217;s really just a weighted
average. For example, for a task with an optimistic time of 4 hours, a
pessimistic time of 7 hours, and an average time of 5 hours, you could
reasonably plan on this task taking about 5.17 hours.  So the next time
you need estimate how long a task will take, whether it&#8217;s delivering a
pizza or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_Evaluation_and_Review_Technique#Overview">building parts for a submarine</a>, think about using this
PERT formula.</p>

<blockquote><h3><a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/137788967/32-bit-limitations">32-bit limitations</a></h3>

<p>32-bit MongoDB processes are limited to about 2.5 gb of data.  This has come as a surprise to a lot of people who are used to not having to worry about that.  The reason for this is that the MongoDB storage engine uses memory-mapped files for performance.</p>

<p>By not supporting more than 2gb on 32-bit, we%u2019ve been able to keep our code much simpler and cleaner.  This greatly reduces the number of bugs, and reduces the time that we need to release a 1.0 product. The world is moving toward all 64-bit very quickly.  Right now there aren%u2019t too many people for whom 64-bit is a problem, and in the long term, we think this will be a non-issue.</p>

<p>This is more recommended reading for those that are considering using MongoDB. For some, this is a deal-breaker. I don’t necessarily agree with this decision, but I do hope that 64bit support by hypervisors and VPS providers is more mature by the time Mongo matures.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><h3><a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/381927266/what-about-durability">What about Durability?</a></h3>

<p>We get lots of questions about why MongoDB doesn’t have full single server durability, and there are many people that think this is a major problem.  We wanted to shed some light on why we haven’t done single server durability, what our suggestions are, and our future plans.</p>

<p>To start, there are some very practical reasons why we think single server durability is overvalued.  First, there are many scenarios in which that server loses all its data no matter what.  If there is water damage, fire, some hardware problems, etc… no matter how durable the software is, data can be lost.  Yes – there are ways to mitigate some of these, but those add another layer of complexity, that has to be tested, proofed, and adds more variables which can fail.</p>

<p>In the real world, traditional durability often isn’t even done correctly.  If you are using a DBMS that uses a transaction log for durability, you either have to turn off hardware buffering or have a battery backed RAID controller.  Without hardware buffering, transaction logs are very slow.  Battery backed raid controllers will work well, but you have to really have one.  With the move towards the cloud and outsourced hosting, custom hardware is not always an option.</p>

<p>Requirements for web applications are also changing.  99.99% uptime is no longer the goal, people want 100% uptime as much as possible.  If you have durability through a transaction log, then you have to replay it to come back up.  If you have a master and slave in the same data center and you lose power, both will have to recover which could take 5-30 minutes.<a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/381927266/what-about-durability">1</a></p>

<p>Another feature of new non-relational databases is horizontal scalability.  While MongoDB’s auto-sharding is still in Alpha, we still feel this is a core component. With horizontal scalability comes many servers.  If you have a 100 node cluster, worrying about every machine is a liability.  If a machine goes down in the middle of the night, you want the system to recover as fast as possible, without human intervention.  Given that, and that a high percentage of failures are hardware, the best thing is to just mark that server as inactive, and ignore it until someone can look at it easily (could be hours or days).</p>

<p>Given all this, we’re not saying durability isn’t important, we just think that single server durability isn’t the best way to get true durability.  We think the right path to durability is replication (local and remote) and snapshotting.  That’s why we’ve spent so much time making replication fast and easy and work over wide area networks in MongoDB.</p>

<p>We are currently planning many more enhancements to replication to make it better.</p>

<ul>
<li>psuedo real-time with optional blocking for writes until on multiple servers</li>
<li>replica sets instead of replica pairs</li>
<li>easier to create new slaves with large data sets</li>
</ul>


<p>Now – there are definitely some cases where single server durability is the best option.  It is on our road map, its just not on the short list right now.  We know what we want to do and how we want to do it, it’s just a matter of code :)</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/381927266/what-about-durability">1</a> Some databases such as CouchDB use an append only model that allows for instantaneous restarts. However, this type of design usually requires compaction routines to be run periodically, so can be costly in high update scenarios.</p>

<p>This is very important to consider for anyone who is thinking about (or already is) using MongoDB.</p></blockquote>
