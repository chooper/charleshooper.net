<p>I wrote a very simple program to read Minesweeper’s memory and display a grid showing where the bombs are. I used OllyDbg for disassembly and reversing and CheatEngine for quickly finding known values in memory. During this process, I found that Minesweeper will sometimes <em>assist you</em> and move bombs away from where you are clicking on. Originally, I thought that Minesweeper was only “spawning” about half of the bombs, but as it turns out I misunderstood the way minefield was represented in memory and all bombs <em>are</em> generated at the <em>beginning</em> of the game and not first click or any later clicks.</p>

<p>My error was in thinking that minefield was stored in a 2-dimensional array (ie: <code>minefield[x][y] = FLAGS</code>) where <em>max(x)</em> (and <em>max(y)</em>) are the size of the grid (ie: 9×9 on Beginner) but as <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/xumiiz/">xumiiz on Reddit</a> pointed out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His program is buggy. It’s not reading the grid in correctly – it’s a constant width of 32 bytes, but a window from the top left is taken for the actual size of the playing field. So, first bugfix to his source:</p>

  <p><code> for(DWORD grid_loc = 0; grid_loc &lt; grid_height * grid_width; grid_loc  ) {</code></p>

  <p>should be:</p>

  <p><code> for(DWORD grid_loc = 0; grid_loc &lt; grid_height * 32; grid_loc  = ((grid_loc2)==(grid_width-1)) ? (32-grid_width 1):1) {</code></p>

  <p>And:</p>

  <p><code>if((grid_loc % grid_width) == (grid_width - 1))</code></p>

  <p>should be changed to:</p>

  <p><code> if((grid_loc % 32) == (grid_width - 1))</code></p>

  <p>With these fixes, it reads all the bombs properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And also <a href="http://www.subversity.net/reversing/hacking-minesweeper#comment-33">this comment from Anonymous</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sorry but your program is reading the grid incorrectly. Minesweeper uses a grid with a fixed width of 32 bytes and the playing field is taken as a window of that grid from the top left. e.g. beginner mode uses bytes 0 to 8 and skips bytes 9 to 31 per every 32 byte row.* Fixing the program to read based on that patten shows that Minesweeper only moves the mine if it happens to be the first square you click on. Apart from that, all mines are randomly placed at the start of the game. (* Actually it would use bytes 0 to 10, where bytes 0 and 10 are 0×10 which is to indicate the border of the mine field, and bytes 1 to 9 are the actual squares. but that’s not really relevant to the analysis if you’re just &amp;ing with 0×80 to find bombs.)</p>

<p>LACP, or <strong>Link Aggregation Control Protocol</strong>, allows you to configure multiple ethernet ports to act as a single device. This is sometimes referred to as <strong>channel bonding</strong> or <strong>trunking</strong>. Link Aggregation provides several benefits: <em>Increased bandwidth</em>, <em>load balancing</em>, and allows you to create <em>redundant ethernet links</em>. If a link in your ethernet channel goes down, the switches, routers, or servers you have configured to use LACP will automatically fail over to the links that are still up and remain connected. With the right hardware and the right firmware, setting this up is very simple. 
On a Cisco Catalyst switch running IOS, once logged in, you will need to perform the following steps:</p>

<p>It also helps to label your ports and to be sure that your bonded ports
are configured in the right VLAN or set up for <em>VLAN trunking</em>.  If your
other device is another Cisco Catalyst, then just repeat the steps
above, connect your newly bonded ports, and disconnect any non-bonded
ports connecting the two devices.  However, if you are configuring a
Foundry switch, your configuration is just as easy, but slightly
different.</p>

<p>Provided you don’t have a complicated VLAN set up, you’re all set! One
thing you should note about the Foundry devices, is that you can only
<em>start</em> your trunked ports on the first port of each group of 4.
Explanation: On a 12-port switch, you would only be able to start port
groups on ports 1, 5, and 9. But this does <em>not</em> mean that you can’t
bond ports 1 &amp; 2 — but it does mean that you can’t bond ports 3 &amp; 4.</p>

<p>IEEE 802.3ad, more commonly known as <strong>Link Aggregation</strong>, allows you to configure multiple Ethernet ports to act as a single device. This is sometimes referred to as <strong>channel bonding</strong>, <strong>Ethernet bonding</strong>, or <strong>trunking</strong>. Link Aggregation provides several benefits: <em>Increased bandwidth</em>, <em>load balancing</em>, and allows you to create <em>redundant ethernet links</em>. If a link in your ethernet channel goes down, the switches, routers, or servers you have configured to use LACP will automatically fail over to the links that are still up and remain connected. On a RedHat-based Linux distribution, such as CentOS or Fedora, the configuration may look a little complex, but in fact, it is very straight-forward.</p>

<p>To enable EtherChannel bonding on your RedHat-based server, follow these four easy steps:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> First, create/replace <code>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0</code> with:</p>

<pre><code>DEVICE=bond0
ONBOOT=yes
USERCTL=no
</code></pre>

<p>This file is also where you will configure your interface options, such as your IP address or if you will be using DHCP to obtain that information automatically. You can find more information on this in the RedHat Linux manual section <a href="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/ref-guide/s1-networkscripts-interfaces.html">Interface Configuration Files</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Next, for each interface you want bonded, create the file (and backup any already-existing ones) <code>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ethX</code>, where <em>X</em> is the number of the interface, for example: eth0 and eth1. Check the output of <code>dmesg</code> or <code>ifconfig</code> if you are confused.</p>

<p>In each of these files, put the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>DEVICE=ethX
ONBOOT=yes
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes
USERCTL=no
</code></pre>

<p>Once again, instead of an <em>X</em> you will want to replace that with the number of the interface.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Add the following text to <code>/etc/modprobe.conf</code> on a line by itself: <code>alias bond bonding</code>. Now would also probably be a good time to review your firewall rules and configuration files, to change any interface-specific directives to refer to “bond0″ now instead of “eth0″, or whatever it may have been before.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Restart your networking scripts. As root, issue the following command: <code>service network restart</code></p>

<p>At this point you may lose connectivity. Do not panic! This is because we have configured the server to use EtherChannel bonding, but we have not told the switch we were going to do so.</p>

<p>On a Cisco Catalyst switch running IOS, once logged in, you enable EtherChannel bonding by performing the following steps. These steps assume that both interfaces are configured in the same (and correct) VLAN, and have the same speed and duplex settings.</p>

<pre><code>cisco&gt;enable
Password: *enter password*
cisco#config term
cisco(config)#int Fa0/1
cisco(config-if)#channel-group 1 mode on
cisco(config-if)#int Fa0/2
cisco(config-if)#channel-group 1 mode on
cisco(config-if)#end
cisco#write mem
</code></pre>

<p>It also helps to label your ports. It is important to understand that your bonded interfaces do <em>not</em> need to be consecutive ports on the switch, but consolidating them to one location on the switch is good for organizational purposes.</p>

<p>Now you are free to plug in your additional cables and enjoy your new redundant Ethernet links!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>This paper is our attempt to deobfuscate the <strong>Actiontec GT701 wireless
gateway</strong>. There are a couple of other websites out there with the same
goal in mind, however, our intent was to provide accurate  information
based off of various sources including both <em>official and un-official
documentation, kernel source, configuration files, and just plain
hacking.</em></p>

<p><strong>Hardware</strong></p>

<p>The hardware making up this unit revolves around the AR7, the AR7 is
Texas Instruments’ “system on a chip” solution for DSL routers. The
hardware of the GT701 (or any other AR7-based device for that matter,)
consists of a power supply, the 160Mhz MIPS 4KEc V4.8 processor, 16Mb of
SDRAM, and 4Mb of FLASH. For your input/output, there’s the RJ-11 for
your DSL, your ethernet device (TI Avalanche CPMAC) jack, a USB port,
and an ACX-11x based (chip # TNETW130) wireless setup as well as 6
status LEDs. On the board, there are also two separate sets of 5 pins
each. These are mostly believed to be serial (JTAG is also possible) due
to Texas Instruments displaying a serial/UART interface on the AR7
diagrams, several pins being attached to the board, and due to the
following ADAM2 variables:</p>

</span><span class="line">bootserport     tty0  </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p><strong>ADAM2</strong></p>

<p>To be perfectly honest, we’re still not entirely too sure what ADAM2
really is. We know that it’s stored on block 2 of the MTD device. We
also know that that it appears to be some sort of system for storing
environment variables in flash used during both boot-time and run-time,
as well as a boot-loader of some sort. We also know that it’s
responsible for storing the MAC addresses, as found in our mtd dump:</p>

<p>When you hold down the Reset button during boot, an FTP server is

<p>There are others, but some of the command names didn’t show up, only the
descriptions, and we don’t have a console hooked up to see them for
ourselves yet.</p>

<p><strong>Software</strong></p>

<p>The Actiontec GT701 runs off of Linux kernel 2.4.17 patched for MIPS,
ATM, SquashFS, and pre-empt (not enabled.) The kernel is provided by
MontaVista and is believed to be the MontaVista Carrier Grade Linux
kernel version 2.1.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">Linux version 2.4.17\_mvl21-malta-mips\_fp_le () (gcc version 2.95.3 20010315 (release/MontaVista)) #24 Fri Jul 16 13:22:25 PDT 2004</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Along with the kernel, the GT701 also runs on top of Busybox 0.61.pre
with uClibc libraries (version 0.9.19.) The root filesystem uses
SquashFS 1.x, which is a compressed, read-only filesystem stored on the
MTD block. One should note that SquashFS 2.x is not backwards-compatible
with 1.x. A ramdisk is mounted at /var and any files that require write
access or either stored there, or symlinked to that tree.</p>

<p>In order to retrieve and edit the file system one would first have to
download SquashFS and compile it into their kernel, as well as build the
user-land tools. Once this is complete your first step would be to
either extract <code>nsp.ar7wrd.squashfs.img</code> from the recovery tool, or do
something similar to the following (while running a tftp server):</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line"># dd if=/dev/mtdblock/0 of=/var/mtd0  
</span><span class="line">6272 0 records in  
</span><span class="line">6272 0 records out  
</span><span class="line"># tftp -p -l /var/mtd0 -p mtd0.img</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>This will give you a mountable SquashFS image wherever you you placed
your tftp root. In order to to write to it though, you will need to copy
a mounted SquashFS directory to a non-SquashFS directory as follows:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

</span><span class="line"># cp -R temp/ fs/  </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>And you now have a write-able directory to edit/delete or whatever else
may please you. Re-creating the image is just as easy:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line"># mksquashfs target.old/ target.img -noappend -check_data  
</span><span class="line">Creating little endian filesystem on target.img, block size 32768.  
</span><span class="line">  
</span><span class="line">Little endian filesystem, data block size 32768, compressed data, compressed metadata  
</span><span class="line">Filesystem size 1897.99 Kbytes (1.85 Mbytes)  
</span><span class="line">33.35% of uncompressed filesystem size (5691.04 Kbytes)  
</span><span class="line">--- Output cut ---  </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>There are two things to keep in mind while building filesystem images.
The first is that the GT701 can only STORE 3,136KB (compressed) on the
FLASH chip. You should at this point, also realize that the filesystem
is decompressed and stored in RAM when mounted, and you only have 16MB
RAM to begin with, so either way, it’s a tight fit.</p>

<p>Actiontec uses a set of utilities to manage your configuration files.
They manage the XML file stored on mtd3 as well as handle your web-based
configuraiton changes. There is also supposed to be a CLI client for it,
however, I haven’t quite figured out how that works yet. These utilities
can usually be identified by having <code>cm_</code> as a prefix, although the CGI
program for the web-based configuration is called <code>webcm</code>, and of
course, we can’t forget <code>libcm.so</code>. The XML file contains all of your
coniguration, including IP addresses, authentication, networking
settings, and probably just about everything else. You can extract a
current version of the file the same way we demonstrated dumping the
filesystem above, but by replacing <code>mtd0</code> with <code>mtd3</code>. You will also need to
strip all of the excess garbage at the end of the file. I should also
note that that mtd3 is monitored regularly for corruption, and if mtd3
happens to become corrupted, it will repopulate the block with
<code>/etc/config.xml</code>.</p>

<p>The list of configuration programs is as follows:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">cm_pc             Started at boot, stdout is /dev/tts/0,starts cm_logic  and cm_monitor  
</span><span class="line">cm_logic          Monitors and re-populates mtd3  
</span><span class="line">cm_monitor        ? ... Not exactly sure.  
</span><span class="line">cm_cli            Used to perform the actual updating of the config files.  
</span><span class="line">webcm             Handles web-based configuration changes, sends them off  to cm_cli</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Webcm is used in conjunction with <code>thttpd</code> to provide a small, yet
working, web-based interface to allow you to make changes to your
gateway’s configuration.</p>

<p>As far as networking is concerned, the GT701 used pppd with a PPPoA
plugin for your connection to your ISP. For telnet and DHCP, the gateway
uses <code>utelnetd</code> and <code>udhcpd</code>, respectively. The Actiontec GT701 also
supports UPNP through the use of upnpd on interfaces <code>ppp0</code> and <code>br0</code>.
<code>br0</code> consists of the USB device, the Ethernet device, and the wireless
device.</p>

<p>The wireless drivers are not compiled into the kernel or as a kernel
module, rather, they are handled by a userland driver called <code>user_drv</code>.
On the original firmware, the <code>user_drv_cli</code> utility provided a very
capable command line interface that allowed you to change many settings
pertaining to the wireless network device. Some of these settings
included what Regulatory domain you were in, for instane, one could take
their access point out of the FCC domain, and place it under the French
domain, or better yet, a custom domain, and change power levels, as well
as usable channels. In the newer firmware, it seems this software has
been crippled, and will not allow you to access the CLI.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The Actiontec GT701-wg is a powerful embedded Linux device running on a
MIPS platform based off of Texas Instruments’ AR7 “one-chip” solution.
It is relatively easy to hack the GT701. The firmware images are
squashFS 1.x images and the base Linux system is run on BusyBox with the
uClibc libraries. If one were to set up a cross-compile environment and
use the squashFS tools they could generate new firmware images with
great ease.</p>

<p>I have been modifying <a href="http://www.honeynet.org/tools/sebek/">Sebek</a> to get it to work in more recent 2.6 series (~2.6.18) kernels and ran into some snags. Most notably, I could not intercept/redirect/wrap any system calls. As it turns out, Sebek couldn’t find the system call table. The code Sebek was using to find the system call table is 100% identical to the code found in <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/6416">this article on KernelTrap</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that code is outdated as either <code>loops_per_jiffy</code>, <code>boot_cpu_data</code>, or <code>sys_call_table</code> appear to have been moved. I found that I could find the system call table between <code>unlock_kernel</code> and <code>loops_per_jiffy</code> and have modified the code as follows.</p>

<pre><code>// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------   
// Sys Call Table Address  
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
unsigned long **find_sys_call_table(void)  {  
unsigned long **sctable;  
unsigned long ptr;  
extern int loops_per_jiffy;
      sctable = NULL;  
for (ptr = (unsigned long)&amp;unlock_kernel; ptr &lt; (unsigned long)&amp;loops_per_jiffy; ptr  = sizeof(void *))    {  
unsigned long *p;  
p = (unsigned long *)ptr;  
if (p[__NR_close] == (unsigned long) sys_close)       {  
sctable = (unsigned long **)p;  
return &amp;sctable[0];  
}  
}  
return NULL;  
}

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>In my other article, <a href="http://charleshooper.posterous.com/link-aggregation-on-cisco-catalysts-and-found">LACP on Cisco Catalysts &amp; Foundry switches</a>, I describe how to configure aggregated links using LACP (802.3ad) on a Cisco Catalyst and Foundry switch. In this howto, I will be describing how to configure trunked ports using <strong>EtherChannel</strong> — LACP’s predecessor.</p>

<p>Before starting, one thing that you should be aware of is that Foundry’s configure EtherChannel trunks as dot1q-encapsulated VLAN trunks by default. Cisco Catalysts (or IOS, rather) configure all ports as access ports by default.</p>

<p>On a Cisco Catalyst switch running IOS, once logged in, you will need to perform the steps below. It is important that you perform these steps without the other device connected.</p>

<pre><code>cisco&gt;enable
Password: *enter password*
cisco#config term
cisco(config)#int Gi0/1
cisco(config-if)#channel-group 1 mode on
cisco(config-if)#int Gi0/2
cisco(config-if)#channel-group 1 mode on
cisco(config-if)#end
cisco#write mem
</code></pre>

<p>If your other device is another Cisco Catalyst, then just repeat the steps above, connect your newly bonded ports, and disconnect any non-bonded ports connecting the two devices.</p>

<p>If you are configuring a Foundry switch, there are <a href="http://www.foundrynetworks.co.jp/services/documentation/sribcg/Trunking.html">several rules you must follow</a>. Among these rules, is that you can only <em>start</em> your trunked ports on the first port of each group of 4.</p>

<pre><code>BR-telnet@foundry&gt;enable
Password: *enter password*
BR-telnet@foundry#config term
BR-telnet@foundry(config)#trunk ethe 1 to 2
BR-telnet@foundry(config)#trunk deploy
BR-telnet@foundry(config)#exit
BR-telnet@foundry#write mem
</code></pre>

<p>Provided you correctly configured your VLANs prior to setting up EtherChannel, you may connect your cables starting with the <em>primary port</em>. The primary port is always the lowest-numbered port in the trunk, in our example, this is 1. Once connected, you can verify operation of your EtherChannel trunk with <code>show etherchannel summary</code> on the Cisco or <code>show trunk</code> on the Foundry in enable mode.</p>

  <li>If so, how intense are the labs?</li>
  <li>What type of equipment is recommended for a CCNP lab?</li>
</ol>

<p>I passed the CCNA with almost no lab time at all, but to be fair I had worked for an ISP and was very familiar with alot of the material covered in the CCNA. I’m not sure that’s going to be the same with the CCNP. 
Thoughts? Advice?</p>

<p>I would like to think that one day we will all be past the point where
we are constantly finding silly bugs and vulnerabilities caused by
unvalidated or unsanitized user input. Unfortunately for us all, we’re
not. In this article, I will attempt to describe a rather overlooked
result of <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.type-juggling.php">PHP’s type juggling</a>.</p>

<p>If you aren’t already familiar, type juggling is PHP’s way of
automatically switching or converting variables to different types based
on the context it’s being used in. For example, if you have the strings
“2″ and “3″ and you add them, PHP will convert them to integers and
return the integer 5. This is useful in PHP web-applications since any
variable that PHP retrieves from either GPC (<em>Get</em>, <em>Post</em>, <em>Cookie</em>)
variables or the database is considered a string. This is regardless of
its actual value or column type in the database and the string will need
to be converted to a numeric type before any type of math operations or
numeric comparisons can be performed on them.</p>

<p>On the lower-level, PHP is actually using libc’s strtod() function. If
we look at the man page, we learn If no conversion is performed, zero is
returned. Without looking at PHP’s source, it would seem to me that PHP
is blindly handing off string pointers to strtod() and if the type
conversion fails it will retain the type of whatever the variable was
last. This isn’t PHP’s fault, it’s the <em>developer’s responsibility</em> to
make sure that the data they are using is properly sanitized!</p>

<p>The best real-world example I can give about this bug was a series of
exploits in the web-based RPG <a href="http://www.bootleggers.us/">Bootleggers</a> last round. One of the
most well known exploits in this series was known to players as “The Arm
Wrestling bug.” This arm wrestling bug was the result of a flaw or
limitation in PHP’s magic type switching that allowed players to bypass
certain logic checks to send extremely large strings of numbers to the
database backend and essentially create money out of thin air, one MySQL
signed integer (2,147,483,647) at a time.</p>

<p>For an example on how we would go about exploiting this, we look at the
following code:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">$var1 = '1';
</span><span class="line">$var2 = '21';
</span><span class="line">var_dump((bool) ($var1 &lt; $var2));
</span><span class="line"># Output: bool(true)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>All this code is doing is assigning strings to two variables and then
doing a numeric comparison of them — In our case, this script will
output “true” since, when evaluated as an integer, 1 is in fact
less-than 21. However, if there is any non-numeric data being passed to
the variable then <code>strtod()</code> will return 0 and PHP will evaluate these
variables as strings and use natural sorting to determine if one
variable is “less”-than another. Proof?</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">$var1 = '111 '; // there is a space before the closing quote
</span><span class="line">$var2 = '21';
</span><span class="line">var_dump((bool) ($var1 &lt; $var2));
</span><span class="line"># Output: bool(true)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>This block of code will <em>also</em> output true because the character <code>1</code>′ is
before the character <code>2</code>′ when using natural sorting. If a user is able
to bypass the logic checks with this exploit, then typically the string
will be sent straight to the database as-is (OK, maybe escaped for
apostrophes ;)). Depending on the DBMS there may be a variance in
behavior. Usually, exploiters will use this attack with a very large
string so that the column being updated with that value will actually
update to the maximum value for that column’s data type.</p>

<p>While exploits on web-based RPGs aren’t the end of the world, imagine if
your <em>bank</em> used a PHP-based web-application. Wouldn’t you feel better
if they all knew about his caveat and properly sanitized and validated
user input? :-)</p>
