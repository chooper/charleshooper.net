<p>When doing homework for my business-related classes, I often find that knowing a programming language is very advantageous. Certainly there are times when it makes sense to use a calculator, but repeatedly entering the same equation over and over is tedious and inefficient. There are also times when it’s a good idea to make a spreadsheet, but even this can be overkill.</p>

<p>In cases where I’m repeating the same tasks or expressions frequently and a spreadsheet seems like overkill, I’ll open a Python shell and define the expression I need as a function. More often than not, these functions are one liners that I probably won’t use again. At least, not until I get a “Real Job (TM)” where I’ll need to use said expressions more frequently.</p>

<p>As an example, I recently found myself calculating the gains and/or losses between two given foreign exchange rates. The example below calculates the gain or loss between two period’s exchange rates for a given currency.</p>

<pre><code>def xchg_diff(qty,old_rate,new_rate):
    """
    qty = Amount of 'domestic currency'
    old_rate = Exchange rate of foreign currency in previous period
    new_rate = Exchange rate of foreign currency in current period
    """
    return round(qty * (new_rate - old_rate))
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the hypothetical company had 850,000 pesos that it held over multiple accounting periods. I was given a table of dates that corresponded with these accounting periods and the exchange rate of pesos to U.S. Dollars (USD $) that looked similar to the one below.</p>

<p>Date</p>

<p>Exchange Rate</p>

<p>Mar 31, 2009</p>

<p>0.0698</p>

<p>Jun 30, 2009</p>

<p>0.0756</p>

<p>Sep 30, 2009</p>

<p>0.0737</p>

<p>Dec 31, 2009</p>

<p>0.0777</p>

<p>The equation is simple enough to type into a calculator, but I find most calculators to have a clumsy interface when it comes to editing the numbers in previous expressions. In this case, I simply opened up a Python shell and, after defining the above function, I typed:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; xchg_diff(850000,0.0698,0.0756)
4930.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; xchg_diff(850000,0.0756,0.0737)
-1615.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; xchg_diff(850000,0.0737,0.0777)
3400.0
</code></pre>

<p>As we can see from the transcript, I was quickly able to find the following results:</p>

<p>Date</p>

<p>Gain / (loss)</p>

<p>Jun 30, 2009</p>

<p>$4930</p>

<p>Sep 30, 2009</p>

<p>$(1615)</p>

<p>Dec 31, 2009</p>

<p>$3400</p>

<p>Many people have asked me if I thought that my experience in computers and programming would go to waste once I entered the world of business and, in particular, finance. My response has been, and will continue to be, “No.” Knowing how to automate routine tasks, being able to write data models, and having a firm grasp on algorithms will only help me to be more effective in my future career.</p>

<p>One of the projects I’ve been working on lately is my <a href="http://apps.charleshooper.net/cost-behavior-analysis/">Cost Behavior Analysis Calculator</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Cost behavior analysis</strong> is the process of dividing a mixed cost into its <em>variable and fixed components</em>. Doing this can be a long and tedious process. This process, when done manually, involves:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Determining which metric or activity <em>drives costs</em>.</strong> A common example in manufacturing is “machine hours.” Using this technique, you could determine how much each “machine hour” affects your power bill.</li>
<li><strong>Making a scatter graph of your data.</strong> When you’re plotting your data, what you’re looking for is that a <em>linear relationship</em> exists between your <em>cost driver</em> and your <em>costs</em>. If a linear relationship doesn’t exist, then it isn’t a cost driver – pick a new metric and try again.</li>
<li><strong>Fitting a line to the scatter graph.</strong> When working on paper, it’s easier to use the <a href="http://www.suite101.com/content/job-costing-using-the-high-low-method-a207711">high-low method</a>. However, this method is considered inaccurate as it only uses two points from your entire data set. Not to mention, the highest and lowest points of these data sets are usually considered “atypical.” The <a href="http://apps.charleshooper.net/cost-behavior-analysis/">Cost Behavior Analyzer</a> uses <a href="http://www.finance-lib.com/financial-term-least-squares-regression-analysis.html">least-squares regression</a> to fit a more accurate line.</li>
<li><strong>Measure your slope and y-intercept.</strong> The <strong>slope</strong> of the line is your <em>variable cost</em> and the <strong>y-intercept</strong> is your <em>fixed cost</em>.</li>
</ol>


<p>I developed the <a href="http://apps.charleshooper.net/cost-behavior-analysis/">Cost Behavior Analyzer</a> because I found that doing this work manually was tedious and repetitive. I’m making it available here so others can benefit from its use. Managerial accountants, financiers, business owners, and entrepreneurs alike should all know what’s driving their costs and how to accurately predict them.</p>

<p>As a result of my now <a href="http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/rip-booksuggest/">defunct project, BookSuggest</a>, I’ve built a fairly large corpus that has been seeded entirely from Twitter. This corpus weighs in at:</p>

<ul>
<li>16,680,000 documents (tweets)</li>
<li>1,970,165 unique (stemmed) words<br/>
<em>(Red flag: <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/page/93">Oxford Dictionary</a> suggests there’s an estimated 250,000 words in the English language. This discrepancy is the result of my failure to filter Tweets based on language, the fact that usernames were included in the count, and the fact that people “make words up.” Also, “haha” becomes one word while “hahahaha” becomes another.)</em></li>
<li>83,758,872 words total.</li>
</ul>


<p>When I look at these numbers, I often think about how the source documents a corpus/histogram is derived from affects the distribution of its term frequencies. The most obvious example is language. A French corpus will never come close to an English corpus. A less obvious example is subject matter. For example, a corpus derived from English literature will have a different term distribution than a corpus derived from an English medical journal. Common terms will have similar frequencies, but there will be biases towards terms that are domain-specific.</p>

<p>To demonstrate, I scraped the “Erotica” section of <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/">textfiles.com</a> and built a corpus based on the data there. The resulting corpus is composed of:</p>

<ul>
<li>4,337 documents</li>
<li>50,709 unique (stemmed) words</li>
<li>10,413,715 words total.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Notes on Term Counting</h2>

<ul>
<li>Words that had a length of <em>less than 4 characters</em> were <strong>discarded</strong></li>
<li>Words were then <em>stemmed</em> using the <a href="http://tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/">Porter Stemming algorithm</a></li>
<li>There may be some slight differences between how words were counted in both corpora, based on minor programming differences</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Data</h2>

<p>Finally, here are the term frequencies with the obvious domain-specific terms in bold:</p>

<li>what (0.55%)</li>
<li>said (0.55%)</li>
<li>could (0.54%)</li>
</ol>


<p>You’ll note that the Twitter corpus had a heavy bias towards the term “<em>follow</em>” whereas the Erotica corpus shows an overwhelming use of the term “<em>cock</em>” (Writers: Use synonyms.)</p>

<h2>Practical Reasons Why This Is Important</h2>

<p>This is important because if I were to build a domain-specific search-engine, I would be better off  seeding my corpus from domain-specific content. If I don’t, my relevance (tf-idf) scores will be inaccurate. For example, an Erotica-specific search engine should decrease the weight for the term “<em>cock</em>” strictly because it has a very high document frequency and is therefore less-significant. Meanwhile, a Twitter-specific search engine should discount the weight of “<em>follow</em>.”</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>To conclude, the subject matter of a document set will create a bias towards domain-specific terms in the document set’s histogram of term frequencies. If you are calculating relevance for any particular document set, you should use a corpus derived from that document set. In other words, if you can, try not to re-use your corpora!</p>

<p>One of the nice features about WordPress is its ability to upgrade and
install plugins on the fly. This is nice because now you don’t need to
be bothered with the hassle of downloading plugins, unzipping their
contents, and transferring them to your web server.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the way in which WordPress determines if it has the
appropriate permissions to upgrade plugins is implemented poorly. When
WordPress doesn’t think it has permission, the admin panel will instead
<strong>prompt you for FTP login information</strong>. This is a problem because
sometimes WordPress will do this falsely even if it <em>does</em> have proper
permissions.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>The way WordPress tries to guess if it has proper permissions is very
primitive. Instead of using PHP’s <a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.is-writable.php">is_writable</a>, WordPress instead
compares the web server’s User ID with the User ID of the wp-content
directory’s owner*. While this might work for a large number of cases,
it doesn’t work in all of them (including mine).</p>

<p>* It’s actually slightly more complicated than this, but the effect is the same.</p>

<h2>The Environment</h2>

<p>I run WordPress 3.x on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS under Lighttpd and PHP5-cgi.
Lighttpd runs as user <code>www-data</code> and group <code>www-data</code>. If I wanted to
let WordPress’ auto-detection of permissions work, I would have to
change the owner of my website directories to www-data. This doesn’t fly
with me, because I also want my user to have easy access to my document
root and don’t like the idea of my data being user-owned by my webserver
user.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>Instead of bending over to WordPress’ permission issues, I was able to
perform the following simple steps to have auto-installing/updating
plugins and themes <em>without </em>changing user ownership of my web files.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>sudo chgrp -R www-data /path/to/wp/wp-content</code></p>

<p> This changes group ownership of wp-content and all sub-directories
to be group-owned by your webserver user. wp-content is where WordPress
stores plugins, themes, cache files, and (AFAIK) file uploads.</p></li>
<li><p><code>sudo chmod -R g+w /path/to/wp/wp-content</code></p>

<p> This makes wp-content and all of its sub-directories group-writable.</p></li>
<li><p><code>sudo chmod g+s /path/to/wp/wp-content</code></p>

<p> This, <code>g+s,</code> is known as <strong>setgid</strong>. This causes newly-created files
to be group-owned by <code>wp-content</code>&#8217;s owning group, in this case <code>www-data</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, add the following to the bottom of <code>wp-config.php</code>. This is
an override built into the WordPress code. For more information, take a
look at <code>wp-admin/includes/file.php</code>&#8217;s function
<code>get_filesystem_method</code>.</p></li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Enable direct file updating in wp-config.php </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">/* Force direct file updating</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">- http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/wordpress-auto-upgrade-and-dumb-permissions/</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">*/</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">define(&#39;FS_METHOD&#39;, &#39;direct&#39;);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So there you have it. WordPress does a poor job of properly detecting file permissions and, in some cases, needs to be overridden. If you’re still having problems after this, <strong>let me know</strong> and I will do my best to help you.</p>

<p>BookSuggest, the web-based book recommendation engine, is officially dead. I’ve been treating BookSuggest as the lowest of priorities for quite some time now and I’m more than happy to declare this project a failure. Here is a brief recap of BookSuggest’s history.</p>

<p>Before BookSuggest was a web application, I used to <a href="http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/how-i-made-money-spamming-twitter-with-contextual-book-suggestions/">spam unsuspecting Twitter users</a> with book recommendations. Eventually, Twitter stepped up their anti-spam stance and suspended my spam account. I retired the project for a while until one day I decided to build a web application around the recommendation technology I was using.</p>

<p>This technology was simply scoring words in a user’s timeline, taking the four highest-scoring words, and then passing them to an Amazon ItemSearch query. More specifically, the type of search in use was what Amazon calls a TextStream search. This search method is what allowed me to get book recommendations, even if the search terms provided weren’t all that great. Without it, it’s not unlikely that my ItemSearches wouldn’t return any results at all.</p>

<p>So imagine my surprise when I read the following in Amazon’s API documentation:</p>

<blockquote><p>Due to low usage, the Product Advertising API operations and response groups listed below will not be supported after October 15, 2010:</p>

<p>…<br/>
Additionally, due to low usage, we will be discontinuing Multiple Operation Requests and the <strong>TextStream</strong> search parameter.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, shoot!</p>

<p>Financially, it makes sense for me to cut my losses here. Back when I was still spamming Twitter, I was pulling over $100/mo. Through the web-app, my referral fees are much smaller. As of this moment, I have a balance of just $9 with Amazon and haven’t cashed out since the start of the project.</p>

<p>Some numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unique Twitter users: 393</li>
<li>Recommendations made: 611</li>
<li>Documents in corpus: 17,458,549</li>
<li>Unique words in corpus: 1,970,165</li>
<li>Top 5 words in corpus: that, just, with, this, have</li>
</ul>


<p>RIP BookSuggest!</p>

<p>We programmers have a natural affinity for writing and using our own code. You can’t really blame us; this is akin to gardeners who prefer to eat vegetables they grow, or brewers who prefer to drink their own beer. However, this oftentimes leads to a frequent re-invention of the wheel. While this isn’t always a bad thing, it doesn’t usually benefit our clients and here’s why:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Increased development time. </strong>If a client is paying you hourly, why should they pay for you to re-invent a solution that already exists? Why write a new CMS if WordPress will do? When you write a new CMS from scratch for a client, you are increasing their development costs.</li>
<li><strong>Freedom in hosting. </strong>It’s no coincidence that many web developers also host their projects as well. This is fine for larger applications, but for the majority of the client work out there your clients should have the freedom to a broad range of hosting options. Vendor lock-in is a terrible thing.</li>
<li><strong>Post-development support. </strong>If a client needs customizations done to the code base, they should be able to solicit the work from almost any developer. Certainly you would want preference in these solicitations, but there shouldn’t be any clients who are stuck with you. When you use your own custom solution, you are increasing your clients’ maintenance costs.</li>
</ol>


<p>I’m <em>not</em> saying that you shouldn’t ever write new code. What I <em>am</em> saying is that your responsibility to the client is to use the best tools for the job and to put together the best solution for them that you can. Sometimes this means flexing your coding muscles and sometimes this means humbly setting up existing software such as WordPress. So please, write new code conservatively and responsibly.</p>

<p>Every once in awhile in my reading I come across a minor reference to what pythonistas refer to as <strong>new-style classes</strong>. One of the nice things about new-style classes is the `property` decorators. These property decorators allow you to build getter and setter methods to access object attributes. This is pretty awesome because now you can perform validation at the model/class level whenever you assign a value to a property of an object.</p>

<p>e.g., In one of my projects, I have an attribute named <em>timestamp</em> that takes a `datetime` object. I was concerned about receiving incorrect types from my input because there are alot of ways a programmer can represent the concept of time. Some realistic possibilities of invalid types in my case are:</p>

<ul>
<li>`time` objects from the time module</li>
<li>`string` objects that contain the date and time (and various possible formats)</li>
<li>`float` or `int` objects that contain a unix timestamp</li>
</ul>


<p>With a setter method, you can test that the new value being assigned to an attribute is the correct type before assigning it. You can also throw an <strong>exception</strong> if it’s not. In other words, you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>from datetime import datetime

class SomeObject(object):    # new-style classes must be subclassed from object
    _timestamp = None

    @property
    def timestamp(self):
        return self._timestamp

    @timestamp.setter    # the prefix must match the read-only getter func name
    def timestamp(self,value):    # the func name must match the read-only getter func name
        if not isinstance(value, datetime):
            raise ValueError(“Timestamp can only be an instance of Datetime”)
        self._timestamp = value
</code></pre>

<p>Go ahead and try it!</p>

<p>I’ve been using <a href="http://chunkhost.com/r/chdotnet">ChunkHost</a> for the past <strong>eight months</strong> to host my website and some minor web applications. After my short, free “beta” period I was given a 30% discount (forever) and billed like a normal customer. I’ve only had to pay <strong>$13.30</strong> a month for a Xen VPS with <strong>512MB RAM</strong>. This used to be pretty competitive <a href="http://blog.linode.com/2010/06/16/linode-turns-7-big-ram-increase/">until Linode increased the RAM for all of their VPS packages</a>. Unfortunately for ChunkHost, this Linode RAM increase and some recent events have persuaded me to <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=2fce38a23c4154c3a1abb4f99aafd6371ee78ecc"><strong>pay the extra 7 bucks to Linode</strong></a>. Here are the three main reasons why I’m ditching ChunkHost:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>No way to give feedback on the service.</strong> First, let me qualify this and say that there <em>is</em> a “Feedback” button on the site. However, more than a quick cursory glance reveals that their feedback system is <strong>inactive </strong>and <strong>neglected</strong>. For example, I have an eight month old feature request that has gone ignored; not rejected, not WONTFIX’d, but ignored. Other customers have older feature requests that have been promised “shortly” and never delivered.<img src="http://cdn.subversity.net/blog_imgs/chunkhost-inactive.png" title="chunkhost-inactive.png" alt="An example of ChunkHost's inactive GetSatisfaction feedback page" />
 

<ul>
<li><p><strong>There is no SLA (service-level agreement) or uptime guarantee.</strong> Recently, I noticed that my VM was down and the main page for ChunkHost was down as well. I emailed support about the outage and was happy to receive a quick reply.</p>

<blockquote><p>Yeah, we’re looking at it now; it looks like networking oddness on one of the host machines. We’ll update Twitter with info as we have it!</p></blockquote>

<p>The “fix” consisted of ChunkHost <strong>rebooting the physical host</strong> my VM was on. This same problem occurred <em>again </em><strong>5 hours later</strong>. I don’t sense any empathy from ChunkHost for bearing with them through their downtime and I certainly haven’t received any type of apology. Am I entitled to one? With the lack of an SLA, maybe not, but I’d be alot less bitter and I might have remained a customer had I received one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not enough notice given for “scheduled” maintenance.</strong> Four days before the two outages I had experienced, ChunkHost performed some scheduled maintenance. I am thankful that the maintenance occurred in off-peak hours, but <strong>I received the notice at the end of the previous day</strong>. This is not adequate notice. Had there been anything critical running on my VM, I would expect adequate notice so I could make proper arrangements ahead of time.
It saddens me to think that my last eight months at ChunkHost were a waste. Fortunately, <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=2fce38a23c4154c3a1abb4f99aafd6371ee78ecc">I’ve been using Linode for my “real services” for just as long</a> and I know that I won’t be disappointed there. If you’re looking for a VM for testing and development purposes only, ChunkHost might be an option – just don’t let your development server evolve into a production server.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>For the unfamiliar, I wrote an article about a week and a half ago titled <a href="http://blog.charleshooper.net/how-i-made-money-spamming-twitter-with-contex">How I Made Money Spamming Twitter with Contextual Book Suggestions</a> and promised that I would follow up with a post on the type of traffic I received. Not only did the article get to be pretty popular with the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> crowd, republished in <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/sai">Silicon Alley Insider</a>, and make me the recipient of a handful of wonderful emails but I even got to visit <a href="http://www.tracked.com/">tracked.com’s engineering team</a> and get schooled on machine learning techniques and A.I. (hi guys!)
Something relevant I should mention is that, just a day before, I had migrated my <a href="http://posterous.com">Posterous</a> blog from one domain to its current place, <a href="http://blog.charleshooper.net">blog.charleshooper.net</a>. To anyone who’s curious, this was a totally painless process. Set up DNS first, update your Posterous settings, and set up 302 redirects so your links don’t break.
<strong>Social Link-Sharing</strong><br/>
Despite finishing my article at 1:00 AM, I thought it was pretty well-written and I wanted my story to be heard, so I decided to get a full night’s sleep, proof-read it in the morning, and submit the link to Reddit, Digg, and Hacker News. Besides the obvious benefits of proof-reading the article while fully-rested, I also recognized that most link-sharing sites weight votes based on time (or rather, some product of votes/time maybe) so submitting my article in the morning meant that it would first show up at the beginning of what I believe to be peak usage. So how’d I do?
Reddit hated it.<br/>
<img src="http://www.charleshooper.net/wp-content/uploads/Picture_1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Digg didn’t care.<br/>
<img src="http://www.charleshooper.net/wp-content/uploads/Picture_2.png" alt="" />
And Hacker News loved it!<br/>
<img src="http://www.charleshooper.net/wp-content/uploads/Picture_4.png" alt="" />
I also make use of Posterous’ “autopost” features and have all my new submissions get posted to Twitter and Facebook. According to Posterous, there were over 77 retweets of my article (most likely from the tweet storm that the Silicon Alley Insider bot and HN bots started) and 7 “likes” on Facebook.
<strong>Traffic</strong><br/>
According to Google Analytics, I’m not very popular. Before publishing my article, I received an average of about 30 visits a day. On the day I published my article, I observed a surge of over 4,600 visitors. From there, the numbers declined daily at a rate that looks very much like exponential decay. It took 10 days for my traffic to return to normal, but that day was a Sunday and the following Monday was almost twice as high (62 visits). For the number geeks, the set of numbers beginning with the peak is (4652, 2688, 1065, 452, 206, 138, 105). I got close with the expression <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=graph">*f(x) = 4652e<sup>(-0.6x)*</sup></a> but that isn’t quite right (maybe I should treat my average visits as a constant.)
Update: I’ve gotten much closer with <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=table[">f(x) = 2658e<sup>(-0.94x)</sup> 30</a></p>

<p><img src="http://www.charleshooper.net/wp-content/uploads/Picture_6-300x168.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Over the time period, my article received over 9,000 unique page views with a bounce rate of over 90% (~93% exit rate.) I remember reading an article a little while ago that stated, on single-page use cases, the bounce rate will always be close to the exit rate unless the analytics software “phones in” after some period of time to register the visit as something other than a bounce. I use Google Analytics and, unless I find out otherwise, I don’t think it does this (although, it does measure “time on page” so maybe it does and Google’s idea of a bounce is different than mine.)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.charleshooper.net/wp-content/uploads/Picture_7.png" alt="" /><br/>
 <strong>Sources</strong><br/>
My largest source of traffic was referring websites making up over 70% of it. Less than 2% was from search engines and I don’t even think that any of it was destined for my article.
<img src="http://www.charleshooper.net/wp-content/uploads/Picture_9.png" alt="" /><br/>
 As for the referring websites, I received traffic from all over. However, most of it was from <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, <a href="http://TechMeme.com">TechMeme.com</a>, and <a href="http://Google.com">Google.com</a>. I looked into “<a href="http://google.com">google.com</a> / referral” versus “<a href="http://google.com">google.com</a> / organic” and the referrals mostly consisted of visitors using Google Reader. What isn’t shown below is the 113 <em>other</em> referring sites. The “<a href="http://daemonology.net">daemonology.net</a>” referral is a result of <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/">HN Daily</a>. As you can see, my top sources are primarily seeded by social media and social link-sharing websites.
<img src="http://www.charleshooper.net/wp-content/uploads/Picture_8-300x198.png" alt="" /><br/>
 <strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>
To conclude, don’t under-value the social sites. If you want some organic link juice then utilize the “chatty” sites like Facebook and Twitter as well as the link-sharing sites such as Hacker News, Reddit, and Digg. There is a hidden benefit to putting yourself out there and asking for alot of attention: You will ensure that your articles, blog posts, and research are high-quality resources of <em>useful</em> information. Essentially, you end up treating each blog post as you would any startup. Experiment first. Create value second. The rest (profit, respect, esteem) comes easy.</p>
