<p>Today, I’m going to show you how to drop from the root user to an unprivileged user in Python for the purpose of running a <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">Tornado</a> app.</p>

<p>First <strong>make a system user</strong> for your project to run as. In my example,
I’ll be using <code>projectuser</code> as the username. Creating this user can be done like so: </p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">sudo useradd --system --user-group projectuser</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Now, in your script that is responsible for starting your Tornado app, you likely have something that probably looks like the following: </p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>Snippet in web.py </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="py"><span class="line"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="err"> </span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="err">   </span> <span class="n">http_server</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tornado</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">httpserver</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">HTTPServer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">application</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="err"> </span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>What we need to do now is define a user to run as and then drop
privileges using a call to <code>setuid</code>. We can do this by replacing the above with: </p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>Modification to web.py </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>And voila, your app should now run as the user you defined! Do note that
only the root user can call <code>setuid</code>. As a result, your script now needs
to be run using <code>sudo</code> or from an <a href="http://subversity.net/python-starting-tornado-apps-at-boot-using-up">upstart startup script</a>, for example. </p>

<p>One caveat is that you won’t be able to use port numbers below 1024
since you are dropping to an unprivileged user before binding to the
port. I think there’s a way to get around this by replacing
<code>http_server.listen()</code> with <code>http_server.bind()</code>, <code>http_server.start()</code>,
and dropping privileges between those calls, but this remains untested
for now. Alternatively, you could use the respective <em>proxy modules</em> for
<a href="http://redmine.lighttpd.net/wiki/1/Docs:ModProxy">Lighttpd</a> or <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/documentation#running-tornado-in-production">nginx</a> to listen on privileged ports.</p>

<p>We often find it beneficial to <em>estimate how long a given task will
take</em>. This comes in handy when trying to quote billable time, set
deadlines, or map out a project timeline on a Gantt chart. In
<em>scientific management</em>, we often use the <strong>Program Evaluation and
Review Technique</strong>, or <strong>PERT</strong>. Under PERT, we let <code>O</code> become the
best-case, or optimistic, time; <code>P</code> becomes the pessimistic time, and
<code>M</code> is the mean or average time. We then use the following formula:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">T = (O * 4M * P) / 6 </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>As you can see, it’s pretty simple as it’s really just a weighted
average. For example, for a task with an optimistic time of 4 hours, a
pessimistic time of 7 hours, and an average time of 5 hours, you could
reasonably plan on this task taking about 5.17 hours.  So the next time
you need estimate how long a task will take, whether it’s delivering a
pizza or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_Evaluation_and_Review_Technique#Overview">building parts for a submarine</a>, think about using this
PERT formula.</p>

  <h3 id="bit-limitations1"><a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/137788967/32-bit-limitations">32-bit limitations</a></h3>

  <p>32-bit MongoDB processes are limited to about 2.5 gb of data.  This has come as a surprise to a lot of people who are used to not having to worry about that.  The reason for this is that the MongoDB storage engine uses memory-mapped files for performance.</p>

  <p>By not supporting more than 2gb on 32-bit, we%u2019ve been able to keep our code much simpler and cleaner.  This greatly reduces the number of bugs, and reduces the time that we need to release a 1.0 product. The world is moving toward all 64-bit very quickly.  Right now there aren%u2019t too many people for whom 64-bit is a problem, and in the long term, we think this will be a non-issue.</p>

  <p>This is more recommended reading for those that are considering using MongoDB. For some, this is a deal-breaker. I don’t necessarily agree with this decision, but I do hope that 64bit support by hypervisors and VPS providers is more mature by the time Mongo matures.</p>

  <h3 id="what-about-durability1"><a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/381927266/what-about-durability">What about Durability?</a></h3>

  <p>We get lots of questions about why MongoDB doesn’t have full single server durability, and there are many people that think this is a major problem.  We wanted to shed some light on why we haven’t done single server durability, what our suggestions are, and our future plans.</p>

  <p>To start, there are some very practical reasons why we think single server durability is overvalued.  First, there are many scenarios in which that server loses all its data no matter what.  If there is water damage, fire, some hardware problems, etc… no matter how durable the software is, data can be lost.  Yes – there are ways to mitigate some of these, but those add another layer of complexity, that has to be tested, proofed, and adds more variables which can fail.</p>

  <p>In the real world, traditional durability often isn’t even done correctly.  If you are using a DBMS that uses a transaction log for durability, you either have to turn off hardware buffering or have a battery backed RAID controller.  Without hardware buffering, transaction logs are very slow.  Battery backed raid controllers will work well, but you have to really have one.  With the move towards the cloud and outsourced hosting, custom hardware is not always an option.</p>

  <p>Requirements for web applications are also changing.  99.99% uptime is no longer the goal, people want 100% uptime as much as possible.  If you have durability through a transaction log, then you have to replay it to come back up.  If you have a master and slave in the same data center and you lose power, both will have to recover which could take 5-30 minutes.<a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/381927266/what-about-durability">1</a></p>

  <p>Another feature of new non-relational databases is horizontal scalability.  While MongoDB’s auto-sharding is still in Alpha, we still feel this is a core component. With horizontal scalability comes many servers.  If you have a 100 node cluster, worrying about every machine is a liability.  If a machine goes down in the middle of the night, you want the system to recover as fast as possible, without human intervention.  Given that, and that a high percentage of failures are hardware, the best thing is to just mark that server as inactive, and ignore it until someone can look at it easily (could be hours or days).</p>

  <p>Given all this, we’re not saying durability isn’t important, we just think that single server durability isn’t the best way to get true durability.  We think the right path to durability is replication (local and remote) and snapshotting.  That’s why we’ve spent so much time making replication fast and easy and work over wide area networks in MongoDB.</p>

  <p>We are currently planning many more enhancements to replication to make it better.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>psuedo real-time with optional blocking for writes until on multiple servers</li>
    <li>replica sets instead of replica pairs</li>
    <li>easier to create new slaves with large data sets</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Now – there are definitely some cases where single server durability is the best option.  It is on our road map, its just not on the short list right now.  We know what we want to do and how we want to do it, it’s just a matter of code :)</p>

  <p><a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/381927266/what-about-durability">1</a> Some databases such as CouchDB use an append only model that allows for instantaneous restarts. However, this type of design usually requires compaction routines to be run periodically, so can be costly in high update scenarios.</p>

  <p>This is very important to consider for anyone who is thinking about (or already is) using MongoDB.</p>

<p>The relationship between an employer and his or her employees isn’t special. It’s also very simple; <em>It’s based on money</em>. The employee works for the employer typically for 1-2 weeks at a time. Following this time period, the employer pays the employee and they’re even again. <em>You’re not friends</em>.</p>

<p>From a management perspective, it is true that you should pay attention to the human element of your employees, this falls under the behavioral approach to management. More specifically, employees that receive attention from their supervisors are, in general, more productive. This is known has the <strong>Hawthorne Effect</strong>. However, <em>this potential increase in productivity is moot if your employees aren’t getting paid</em>. Speaking from experience, here’s what will happen if you’re not paying your employees:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your employees will show up for work late with increasing frequency</li>
  <li>Some days, they might not come in at all</li>
  <li>They’ll take long lunches</li>
  <li>They’ll leave early</li>
  <li>They’ll fuck off provided they actually do show up. Productivity will be down</li>
</ol>

<p>And here’s why: When I worked for a company that hadn’t paid anyone in two months, everyone gained a <strong>sense of entitlement</strong>. “They <em>owe</em>us. They’re lucky we’re even showing up for work at all!”</p>

<p>I still agree with that statement, they were lucky we even showed up at all. But here’s the problem: When you finally do pay your employees, you have to provide back pay, and you’re paying them their normal rate/salary. Not the “fuck-off and waltz in at noon” rate.</p>

<p>Here’s what’s worse: If an unpaid employee decides to leave or you decide to fire or lay them off, you are opening yourself up for a <strong>huge liability</strong>. In some states an employee is due their check the day that they leave (California, if given notice) or by the following payday (<a href="http://www.ctdol.state.ct.us/wgwkstnd/laws-regs/wglaws.htm">Connecticut Labor Law</a>.) <em>If you can’t pay your employee, they have the option of reporting you to the Department of Labor</em>. What happens then? You’re forced to pay the employee and fined additional monies. For what amounted to ~$200 unpaid wages, another former employer of mine would have been liable for an additional $500-$1000 in fines. In addition to the monetary penalties, you also risk getting audited. As a bookkeeper friend once told me: <em>You never want to open your books for anybody.</em>(Cool backstory, she had to open hers for a grand jury.)</p>

<p>If for some reason you really can’t pay your employees on time, you’re going to have to work something out with each of them on an individual basis. Make a *payment plan *with each them that you actually manage. Most importantly, <strong>GET YOUR AGREEMENT IN WRITING AND SIGNED BY BOTH PARTIES!</strong>Do not try to get the employee to waive amounts of their pay. In some states, this is illegal!</p>

<p>So, seriously, pay your employees or there may be serious consequences. If you can’t, work out a payment plan and get it in writing and signed.</p>

<p>P.S. – I’m not a lawyer, I’ve just been on the receiving end (or lack thereof) of not getting paid a couple of times and know the mentality, as well as my rights.</p>
