<p>Kaizen is Japenese for “good change” or “improvement” and is frequently
used within the context of lean manufacturing. Today though, I’m going
to talk about a few things I want to improve for myself, both personally
and professionally.</p>

<h2 id="hard-skills">Hard Skills</h2>

<p>I’m fascinated by new technology and new ways of doing work, so
polishing up on some of my so-called “hard skills” comes relatively
natural to me. Things like learning a new programming language or a new
tool require only time which I’m more than willing and able to invest.
Without further ado, here are the hard skills I’d like to improve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Become proficient in <strong>Go</strong>. I find Go very appealing as a
language, specifically for systems-level uses.</li>
  <li>Become proficient in <strong>Ruby</strong>. Alot of the software I’m
responsible for maintaining at Heroku is written in Ruby.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Become proficient in a <strong>functional programming language</strong>,
such as <strong>Erlang</strong>. I’ve been interested in learning a functional
programming language for a while. I decided on Erlang after hearing a
talk from <a href="http://christophermeiklejohn.com/">Chris Meiklejohn</a> (of Basho) about Riak and watching
several talks about Erlang and Erlang/OTP.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="soft-skills">Soft Skills</h2>

<p>Addressing soft skills is something that’s a little more difficult for
me, but something that I think is important. These are the soft skills I’d
like to improve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Become better at <strong>empathy</strong>. Sometimes when listening to someone,
it’s easy to jump to conclusions about what they are trying to say or
how they came to that point. What I have been working on, however, is
understanding <em>why</em> they feel a certain way in particular.</li>
  <li>Become a <strong>better listener</strong>. I have been working on this for a while,
but one area I would still like to improve is learning to ask the the right
questions. I’m always impressed when someone follows up something I
said with an engaging question, and I would love to gain that ability.</li>
  <li>Become more <strong>well-spoken</strong>. I’d like to be a better public speaker,
both publicly and privately.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>I was playing around with my site today and realized that I hadn’t
disclosed much about how it works. Here’s that nerd “look at my site
architecture you guys” post.</p>

<p>If you couldn’t tell by the default theme, my blogging software of
choice is <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, which generates my site’s HTML from Markdown.
I use <code>vim</code> for most of my editing and do so on my Lenovo Thinkpad X220
running Ubuntu desktop. I use a tiling window manager called <a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">Awesome
WM</a>.</p>

<p>I also use <a href="http://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a> for my caching layer. For the purposes of this
dicussion, let’s just call Fastly “varnish as a service.”</p>

<p>Prior to today, I just used a single <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=2fce38a23c4154c3a1abb4f99aafd6371ee78ecc">Linode</a> in the Newark, NJ datacenter
as my web server. The Linode runs Ubuntu server and serves static HTML
with <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a>.</p>

<p>As of today, though, I’m experimenting with <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku US</a> and have
configured my Heroku clone of the site as a second backend server for
Fastly. Octopress does some magic here by serving the HTML through
<a href="http://rack.github.io/">Rack</a>, a minimal webserver for ruby.</p>

<p>My site is also monitored by <a href="http://www.pingdom.com/">Pingdom</a> and I use <a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/">Munin</a> for
metrics collection.</p>

<p>There are some really amazing takeaways from this. For one, my only
expense currently is the roughly $20/mo I pay for the <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=2fce38a23c4154c3a1abb4f99aafd6371ee78ecc">Linode</a>. I
would happily pay for any of these services for a real, money-making
website but, for this site, I’ll continue to use the free plans.</p>

<p>Second is how much technology is available to us these days. I own
<em>zero</em> physical infrastructure and the only thing slightly resembling
traditional infrastructure is my Linode. Contrast this to several years
ago when I had a third generation HP Proliant DL380 colocated and was
starting to experiment with virtualization. I mean, holy shit, you can
literally host a website for nothing!</p>

<p>This second point is why I think I love working in the PaaS
(platform-as-a-service) space so much. PaaS is still young enough that
many skeptics don’t believe it’s a working model. I think we’ve proven
that it works, now we just need to prove we can grow with the needs of
our customers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Moved to San Francisco</li>
  <li>Took time off to decompress</li>
  <li>Joined team at Heroku</li>
  <li>Loving it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="code--verbosecode"><code>--verbose</code></h2>

<p>It’s been a while since I’ve posted, but I wanted to let you know that
I’m still alive! Things were very hectic due to a few life changes but I
much of the dust has settled now and I’m excited to talk about what
those changes are.</p>

<p>But first, some history.</p>

<p>In 2011, I was a junior at university studying Business
Information Systems. I had some prior systems engineering and operations
experience and was paying my tuition by performing contract work for a
company that doesn’t exist today. While at this company, I worked very
closely with a developer and the two of us were responsible for running
this company’s infrastructure. Neither of us had the time or the
willpower to be bothered by operational tasks, so we automated
everything. Even though our environment was much smaller (somewhere
between 30-50 instances in EC2) than many others, we had alot of things
that many companies are lacking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New services were in configuration management</li>
  <li>New deployments were almost entirely automated</li>
  <li>We had good visibility with a variety of metrics being reported to Ganglia and Graphite</li>
  <li>We even had a reasonable nagios configuration</li>
</ul>

<p>Around this time, the term <strong>devops</strong> was being tossed around on twitter
on a more frequent basis. I can remember actually having a Google Alert
for the term to email me when there were new blog posts about it and it
<em>not</em> being spammy. I have a love/hate relationship with the term, and
in December 2011 I wrote my blog post <a href="/blog/concurrent-engineering-the-foundation-of-devops/">Concurrent Engineering: The
Foundation of DevOps</a> in which I argued that the ideas behind devops
weren’t new, but were maybe old ideas from business that were recently
independtly re-discovered.</p>

<p>The blog post wasn’t very popular, but Solomon Hykes (CEO of dotCloud)
managed to see it and, thinking we had very similar ideas about devops,
invited me to interview for a position on their newly formed Site
Reliability Engineering team. I got the job at dotCloud, and up until
April of this year that’s where I stayed.</p>

<p>In mid-April, I resigned from my position at dotCloud and moved to San
Francisco. There were a number of reasons for the resignation but chief
among them was that I needed some time to decompress and all of my paid
time-off had been used up following my youngest brother’s car accident.
This ended up being an awesome decision because it gave me my
much-needed decompression time and I was able to explore my new city.</p>

<p>I took about four weeks off before I put any real effort towards a job
search. The move to San Francisco and the job search alone could fill
two entirely-too-verbose blog posts but the end result was that I moved
here safely and joined the team at <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>!</p>

<p>Fast forward to today and I’ve just finished my third week at Heroku.
It’s an amazing experience, a great team, and an awesome culture that is
encapsulated in the following quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I like our culture. We welcome failure into our house and then kick
its teeth in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ll write more about this another time. For now, thank you for
listening to my story.</p>

<p>— Charles</p>

without an operations background in order to introduce certain best
practices regarding Operations. For the rest of the blog posts, please

<p>Collecting metrics is another area that many early stage startups seem
to overlook even though it is probably one of the most important things
they can do. By metrics collection, I am referring to the gathering and
storing of various metrics at several different levels. As John Allspaw
identifies them in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Web-Operations-Keeping-Data-Time/dp/1449377440">Web Operations: Keeping the Data on Time</a>, they
are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>High-level business and application metrics</strong> (e.g. user sign-ups)</li>
  <li><strong>Feature-specific application-level metrics</strong> (e.g. widgets processed)</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Systems and service-level metrics</strong> (e.g. server load or database queries per second)</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll note that there are two levels of “application-level” metrics.
The higher-level application metrics are mostly those that can be tied
to business objectives, while the other category of application metrics
are generally more feature specific.</p>

<p>Benefits incurred by collecting these metrics are plentiful. For one,
having quick access to these metrics is helpful during troubleshooting
and incident response. For example, I was once hired under contract to
look into why a certain company’s API was unreliable for the previous
few months. At least once per day, this company’s API would time out and
not respond to client requests. After enabling basic metrics collection
for the servers and services used by the API, it very quickly became
obvious that the database servers were reaching their connection limits
which was preventing the API from retrieving records from the database.
Not only was this problem identified very quickly, but later on we were
able to look back at our metrics data to assess how close to our limits
we were getting.</p>

<p>Another benefit is that you can integrate the metrics into your
<a href="/blog/intro-to-ops-availability-monitoring-alerting/">Availability monitoring</a> system to be alerted when metrics surpass
some threshold or change significantly. Not only that, but analyzing
these metrics will allow you to manage your capacity intelligently and
build a business case to justify infrastructure expenditures. Finally,
analyzing these metrics will also give you insight into your
application, how it’s used, and your business.</p>

<p>How you go about collecting and storing these metrics is up to you. Many
engineers might be tempted to build their own solution; however, there
are many open source and third party software packages that you may find
helpful. Key considerations when choosing which package or packages to
use are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ability to add new, custom metrics</li>
  <li>Configurable resolution/storage trade-off</li>
  <li>Integration with availability monitoring and alerting systems</li>
  <li>Graphing/visualization</li>
</ul>

<p>If your startup doesn’t have any metrics then you should start
collecting them now. The visualization will help you in the short run
and the historical data will help you in the long run.</p>

<p><em>I’m writing a series of blog posts for managers and other people

visit the <a href="/blog/intro-to-ops-for-startups/">introductory Intro to Operations</a> blog post!</em></p>

<p>Another area I’ve seen alot of early stage startups lacking in is
<strong>availability monitoring and alerting</strong>. The essence of availability
monitoring and alerting is being notified when your service is not
working as expected, including when it’s simply down, isn’t meeting
formal or informal SLAs (e.g., it’s too slow), or certain functionality
is broken.</p>

<p>What I typically see is that some effort was made to set up this type of
monitoring before and never maintained. Symptoms include <em>poor
monitoring coverage</em> (<em>servers missing from the config, services
monitoring nearly non-existent</em>), <em>large amounts of false positives and
negatives</em>, <em>inactionable alerts</em>, and <em>alerts that go unignored</em>
because of the previous issues.</p>

<p>Symptoms on the business include not knowing when your service is down
and finding out that your service is broken <em>from your customers</em>.
Finding out that your service is down from your customers is not only
embarrassing but it also shakes their confidence in you, affects your
reputation, and may even lead to lost revenue.</p>

<p>The good news is that it doesn’t have to be this way. When availability
monitoring is set up properly, maintained, and you and your employees
agree to approach alerts a specific way, you will be able to reap a
variety of benefits. Here’s what I recommend:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, collaborate with your employees to define who is in the pager
  rotation and the escalation policies. Ask yourself: What happens when
  the on call engineer is overwhelmed and needs backup? What happens when
  the engineer goes on vacation?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next, take inventory of what services you rely on and define an
  internal SLA for them. This does not have to be a super formal process,
  but this inventory and SLA will be helpful for deciding what thresholds
  to set in your monitoring to avoid false positives. Try to see the big
  picture and think about everything such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Servers,</li>
      <li>Self-managed supporting services like web servers, databases, email services,</li>
      <li>Application functionality and features - one strategy I like is exposing a “health check” service that can be checked by the monitoring agent,</li>
      <li>Third party services like remote APIs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Your inventory and SLA definition is a living document; remember to
  keep it up to date!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Then set up whatever monitoring package you or your engineers decided
  to use (self-hosted or third party) such as <a href="http://www.nagios.org/">nagios</a>, <a href="http://www.zenoss.com/">Zenoss</a>,
  <a href="http://www.pingdom.com/">Pingdom</a>, or <a href="http://www.copperegg.com/">CopperEgg</a> and have your monitoring configured for
  those services. If you’re really good, you’ll <em>check your configuration
  into its own source control repository</em>. If you go the self-hosted
  route, it may also be worth having your monitoring server monitored
  externally.  Who’s watching the watcher indeed. </li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>Think about integrating your monitoring with a pager service such as
  <a href="http://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>. Services like PagerDuty allow you to input your pager
  rotation and then define good rules for how to contact the on call
  engineer and when to escalate should the engineer be unavailable.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>With improved monitoring and alerting in place, you may want to think
  about giving certain customers “911” access. At a previous company I
  worked at, we had a secret email address our big customers could hit
  which would <em>open a support ticket</em> and then <em>page the on call engineer</em>
  with the ticket number. If you decide to go this route; however, you’ll
  want to <em>train your customers</em> when it’s appropriate to use this power
  and how to use it most effectively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adjust alerts and fix problems as you get paged for them. Don’t care
  that a particular API goes down during a known maintenance window?
  Schedule the notification policy accordingly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, continue maintaining your inventory and monitoring
  service’s configuration. For extra benefit, consider tracking your
  organization’s <strong>Mean Time To Respond</strong> (how long it took for engineer to
  acknowledge that something is wrong) and your <strong>Mean Time To Recover</strong>
  (how long it took the engineer to resolve the issue <em>including</em> the Mean
  Time To Respond), your <strong>Mean Time Between Failures</strong> (self-explanatory,
  I hope), and <strong>Percent Availability</strong> (what percent of time your service
  is functional in a given period of time). </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This concludes the management and non-ops introduction to operations; I
hope you find this helpful.</p>

<p><em>I’m writing a series of blog posts for managers and other people
without an operations background in order to introduce certain best
practices regarding Operations. For the rest of the blog posts, please
visit the <a href="/blog/intro-to-ops-for-startups/">introductory Intro to Operations</a> blog post!</em></p>

<p>One of the areas I’ve witnessed early stage startups lacking in is
<strong>configuration management</strong>. <em>Configuration management is the process of
standardizing and enforcing configurations</em>. In other words,
configuration management is about deciding on a specific configuration
of services for various roles and then applying these configurations in
practice. Typically, these manifests are written in (domain-specific)
language and is specific to the <em>configuration management software</em>
being used, such as <a href="https://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a>, <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">chef</a>, <a href="http://cfengine.com/">cfengine</a>, or
<a href="http://saltstack.com/community.html">salt stack</a>.</p>

<p>There are many benefits to configuration management. For one,
configuration management allows developers to spend more time working on
the product and less time deploying new services. This is because
configuration is now automated and faster as a result. In addition,
environments are standardized and therefore less time is spent
troubleshooting or diagnosing edge cases in different environments.
Finally, when coupled with <em>source control management</em>, the proper use
of configuration management can be used to track and audit what has
changed over time and who changed it.</p>

<p>In many of these early stage startups, there is either very little
configuration management performed at all, or configuration management
exists as a series of shell scripts cobbled together to do some
post-hardware setup. If you’re lucky, there exists a document somewhere
that describes when and how to run these scripts to deploy new services.</p>

<p>The way configuration management works is that engineers create a
collection of files that define how the system should be configured.
This collection of files is typically called a <strong>manifest</strong>. Then, once
physical or virtual hardware has been provisioned, one of these
manifests is <em>applied</em> to the new host. During application, the
configuration management software will interpret the new configuration,
install software packages, manage users and credentials, alter config
files, manage file permissions, run arbitrary commands, and so on. Once
the manifest is fully applied, the new host should be fully configured
and ready to be used!  In some environments; however, they may be a
post-host-provisioning step where additional work is performed
afterwards, such as checking out application code from a source control
repository.</p>

<p>If you’re not using configuration management already then you should
start now because, frankly, it’s never too early. Starting configuration
management now will not only help your first hired ops/systems engineer
from working backwards to write these manifests later, but will also
incur benefits (such as your developers spending less time away from
shipping value-added code) that will outweigh the initial learning
curve.</p>

<p>Sorry for the RSS spam, everyone. I switched blogging platforms recently
from <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. When I updated my feed URL in
<a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">Feedburner</a>; however, I’m told it re-posted all of my previous blog
posts in multiple RSS readers as unread. This resulted in a ton of
annoying spam for alot of people, particularly those using <a href="http://www.feedly.com/">Feedly</a>
and Google Reader.</p>

<p>I’ve spent the last few years in a variety of roles for early stage tech
startups. While in these roles, I’ve noticed a pattern: <em>Early stage
startups don’t give much thought to their operations. In particular,
they typically don’t hire anyone specifically for that role because they
are focused on building their product.</em> In other words, all of their
technical hires are for developers.</p>

<p>What tends to happen in my experience is that <em>their developers soon
become overwhelmed</em> (especially after a growth spurt) and are unable to
spend their time shipping code that’s going to improve their product or
make their company money. Eventually, if they’re lucky, management catches
onto this and hires their first <strong>systems or operations engineer</strong>.</p>

<p>Because I’ve had the opportunity to be first-hired systems engineer,
what I’ve experienced is the effect of “working backwards” to undo a
bunch of things that weren’t done following best practices while
simultaneously moving things forward to improve them.</p>

<p>I decided to try to educate whoever would be willing to read this
(hopefully early stage startups!) about some <em>best practices</em> that will
not only save their future operations engineers some headache, but will
also improve their business. Part of this education will happen in the
form of one-on-one time with these startups. For example, I spent the
last couple of days sitting in on office hours at a startup accelerator.
The other part; however, will take place by writing “Intro to…”
articles and publishing them to a variety of places, including this blog.</p>

<p>Specifically, the topics I’ve chosen to write about are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/blog/intro-to-ops-config-management/">Configuration management</a></li>
  <li><a href="/blog/intro-to-ops-availability-monitoring-alerting/">Availability monitoring</a></li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/intro-to-ops-metrics-collection/">Metrics collection</a></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>Over the next week or so, I’ll write about each one of these topics and
post them to this blog. I hope people find them helpful!</p>

<p>Here are some stats from 2012:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only 3 posts published.</li>
  <li>50,791 pageviews.</li>
  <li>36,176 visitors (32,007 unique)</li>
  <li>71.97% bounce rate.</li>
  <li>Same great position at dotCloud!</li>
</ul>

<p>Interestingly, my stats compared to last year aren’t too different, despite the fact that I only wrote 3 blog posts this year (instead of 10 last year). What’s also interesting is the HUGE spike in bounce rate (which used to be almost non-existent). This spike begins right around the time I hit a “home run” in terms of driving new traffic.</p>

<p>Going forward, I am going to try to post more (<em>again</em>). I’ve said this before but have yet to succeed. This time around, I changed my posting rules to allow me to write about topics more personal to me or more opinionated in nature.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>Since I’ve only written 3 blog posts so far this year and alot has changed, here’s a brief summary of what I’ll be writing about in my annual review:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I stopped doing contract work and started working for dotCloud part time,</li>
  <li>As of tomorrow, I’ll officially have completed the requirements for my Bachelor’s degree,</li>
  <li>I found myself, politically (I won’t be writing about this, but it is a big deal to me).</li>
</ul>

<p>What does the future hold for me?</p>

<ul>
  <li>dotCloud offered me a full time position and I accepted; I will start January 2nd,</li>
  <li>I have a variety of side projects planned but it’s too soon to tell how much of my free time I’ll want to spend on them,</li>
  <li>I hope to become more involved with my local community and the ACM,</li>
  <li>I’ve made the decision to stop writing so much on Facebook and Twitter and write more here.</li>
</ul>

<p>That last item has big implications for this blog. It means that I’ll be writing about more personal subjects and opinions I have instead of wasting that effort on Twitter and Facebook (where relatives I haven’t seen in 20 years take the opportunities to rant on my wall). Some of these opinions may also be controversial and, that’s OK, we’re meant to disagree on some things. Some of them may even be ill-formed as they’ll be outside of my area of expertise. That’s OK too, just write me and educate me.</p>
