<div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>Two winters ago I left a position as a system administrator that was paying pretty well and moved cross-country to a region with less jobs than where I moved from. Three months later, I was still unemployed, broke, and bored. I was talking to my good friend <a href="http://japherwocky.posterous.com/">Japhy</a> on IRC one day and he was explaining to me how the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf–idf">tf-idf algorithm</a> works. For reasons involving boredom more than any other reason, I dreamed up an idea: <strong>I would write software that would take a given document and generate book suggestions based on its content.</strong> </p>

<p>I think that most programmers would agree with me that we put in longer hours on code when we’re not working for anybody. We don’t stop learning, either. To us, <em>unemployment is a brief sprint of academia</em> spent in our home office, the local coffee shop, or our parent’s house. 
My imagination dreamed up this fairly straightforward process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take a given document and calculate tf-idf scores on all terms</li>
  <li>Select X number of the highest scoring terms</li>
  <li>Pass these high-scoring terms to an Amazon ItemSearch query</li>
  <li>Receive a list of recommended books (with URLs) from Amazon</li>
</ol>

<p>I had already written multiple Twitter bots by this time so I decided to just use some of my existing code to poll Twitter’s search API. Essentially, the “documents” I mentioned above were actually tweets containing the terms “book” or “books.” Two and a half days later I had a working prototype that could generate a book recommendation from a given tweet. It was at this time that I added steps 5 and 6:</p>

<p>Tag URLs returned from Amazon’s ItemSearch with an affiliate ID; and<br />
Reply to the tweeting user with their new book suggestion</p>

<p>Four months later and <strong>I had generated over $7,000 in sales for Amazon with over $400 commission for myself</strong>. Obviously, the commission I was making wasn’t livable but it was a nice addition to my then-depleting savings. Had I decided to scale out my operation, I could have made much more. My benchmark is at four months because that’s how long I went before being <em>suspended</em>. My conversion rate? <strong>0.13%</strong>! While seemingly low, this number is very high when compared to email spam. However, it’s important to note that email spam is subject to various filtering technologies.

A fair amount of the time I share this story, people are more impressed with the fact that I went 4 months before getting suspended. The truth is, I had a lot of throttling built into my spam bot. The factors I think are important to point out are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Twitter’s Terms of Service at that time basically only outlawed “unsolicited replies,” nothing that really attacked targeted spam.</li>
  <li>Twitter’s anti-spam stance did exist in writing (only in the help site,) but I do not think they were actively enforcing their policies.</li>
  <li>My recommendations were contextual and, unless you looked at my bot’s timeline and tweet count, looked legitimate (most of the time.) In other words, I was tweeting <em>book suggestions</em> to people who were already talking about <em>books</em>.</li>
  <li>I recorded the usernames of everyone I sent recommendations to and would only @mention them once.</li>
  <li>I built in a “chattiness” rate limiting function. This was to distribute my spam throughout a whole hour (due to Twitter’s rate limiting) more than anything.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="http://sub-public.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_imgs/twitter-suspended.png" alt="twitter-suspended.png" title="twitter-suspended.png" /> </p>

<p>While it only lasted a short while, I had alot of fun and made a little bit of money spamming Twitter. </p>

<p>The second re-incarnation of this project turned into <a href="http://www.charleshooper.net/twitter/">BookSuggest, a website for recommending books based on a person’s Twitter feed</a>. I haven’t put alot of effort into promoting it, but my conversion rate is much lower now that I’m not pushing the links in anyone’s face. </p>

<p>Try it out and comment here – what did BookSuggest tell YOU to read?</p>
