<p><img class="left" src="https://scontent.fsjc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/11021236_10153134291301703_2769454311846845625_n.jpg?oh=8c673907f07dfb96ce3ad11e5a43ab1b&amp;oe=560176B4" width="270" height="480" title="Archery" /></p>

<p>When people learn that I’m a traditional archer, they tend to ask me a number of
questions. I thought this might be a fun blog post, so here we go!</p>

<h2 id="how-far-do-i-shoot">How far do I shoot?</h2>

<p>I don’t shoot very far! Because I’m currently focused on form (more on
that below), I am only shooting from between ten to twenty meters.</p>

<h2 id="how-accurate-am-i">How accurate am I?</h2>

<p>I’m not at all because I’m currently focused on <em>precision</em>. This is
mostly a matter of form and consistency, which is why I don’t have to
“shoot” (“loose”? “let”?) from very far. I can spend an entire session
at 10 meters and get very rapid feedback on this, so I do. (Note: I’m
being pedantic about prevision vs accuracy, explanation in the image
below).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://cdn.antarcticglaciers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/precision_accuracy.png" width="417" height="278" title="&#34;Precision vs Accuracy&#34;" alt="&#34;Precision vs Accuracy&#34;" /></p>

<p>A variation of this question is sometimes if I’ve ever “robin hooded” an
arrow. <em>Robin hooding</em> is when you shoot one arrow back into another
one.</p>

<p><img src="https://scontent.fsjc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/11081355_10153196646961703_930555660984900106_n.jpg?oh=44502f240ac9e784ea060ce2d0e06adc&amp;oe=55FFC92E" alt="Not yet - arrow damage" /></p>

<p>My answer today is “not yet!”</p>

<h2 id="have-you-seen-the-video-of-that-danish-guy-lars-something-its-really-amazing">Have you seen the video of that Danish guy? Lars something? It’s really amazing!</h2>

<p>Ah yes, Lars Anderson. He’s done <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lars+anderson">a couple of
videos</a> but
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEG-ly9tQGk">one in particular</a> has
gotten a lot of attention recently.</p>

<p>The videos are pretty amazing to watch and highly entertaining, but you
won’t find me doing those things any time soon. I’m perfectly content
right here.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://scontent.fsjc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/11209693_10153295331296703_5424043068009224924_n.jpg?oh=9a0a04c3728c5ed68e5efa6708708160&amp;oe=56035DA8" width="270" height="480" title="&#34;Archery point of view&#34;" alt="&#34;Archery point of view&#34;" /></p>

<h2 id="where-do-i-go">Where do I go?</h2>

<p>There’s an <a href="http://www.golden-gate-park.com/archery.html">archery range in Golden Gate
Park</a> which is free to
use. Nearby is the <a href="http://www.bysel.com/sfarch/">San Francisco Archery Pro
Shop</a> which has good lessons and cheap
all-day rentals.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-i-get-started">How did I get started?</h2>

<p>I had been interested in archery for several years but it wasn’t until a
couple of months ago that I finally tried it.</p>

<p>I went to a <a href="http://www.bysel.com/sfarch/">local shop</a> and took my first
lesson. It was so much fun that I took another one and, when I tried to
sign up for my third, my instructor suggested that I should make some
time to practice all of the things I’ve just learned on my own.</p>

<p>So I rented the equipment a few times and eventually just bought my own.</p>

<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7581/16173441916_fab90e3b9a_z_d.jpg" alt="Two gallons of honey" /></p>

<p>For Christmas this year, one of the wonderful gifts I received was this
two gallon bucket full of fresh, local honey. My friend, the gift giver,
offered the suggestion of brewing some mead which is too sweet for my
tastes. So what should I do with it then?</p>

<p>I thought I’d <a href="https://byo.com/light-ale/item/322-brewing-with-honey">brew some beer with it</a> but two gallons of pure honey (or
whatever that translates to in weight) is alot of honey and, since I’m
currently only doing one gallon batches of home brewed beer, it’ll take take
quite a bit of homebrew to get through it all.</p>

<p>A quick <a href="http://www.saveur.com/find/honey">search for honey recipes</a> yields some interesting ideas as
well, with the top contender being these <a href="http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Sweet-and-Sour-Glazed-Pork-Chops-Maiale-in-Agrodolce">sweet and sour glazed pork
chops</a>.</p>

<p>So what do you think? What should I do with all this honey?</p>

<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8649/16189710525_1191b9eb7f_z_d.jpg" alt="Dying zucchini (courgette)" /></p>

<p>Yesterday I walked out to my yard to find that all of my zucchini
(courgette) plants are dying. It was cold enough the night before to
kill them all at once and there really isn’t any saving them.</p>

<p>We got greedy at first and wanted to reclaim the wasted space, until we
realized that our garden has been running strong for about 9 months now,
since Erica and I planted our first seeds of the season in March of last
year. Now we’ve decided to give it a rest so we can add some new compost to
fortify the soil.</p>

<p>For me, the dying zucchini plants serve as a reminder that nature
intends for us to rest and will find a way to see that we do (sometimes
permanently). Plants drop seed, decompose, and ultimately end up feeding
their offspring. Animals need to eat and sleep.</p>

<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7541/15568029134_2263d267b9_z_d.jpg" alt="Caesar not sleeping" /></p>

<p>It’s a new year and you likely just had some time off that wasn’t very
restful. If you’re like me, you were probably busy traveling, shopping,
worrying about money, or the holidays may even open up some new wounds
for you. Don’t accept this as your vacation for the year.</p>

<p>Your real vacation should be about rest and relaxation. You can travel
or you can stay home, but the bottom line is that you should be
relaxing. Sleep in some days if you’d like. When you’re awake, maybe
read a book, go for a walk, or take up that hobby you’ve been thinking
about. On my last stay-cation, I tried our archery for the first time
and have been hooked ever since.</p>

<p>So start planning your time off now. Trust me, it’s worth it.</p>

    <link href="http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/on-slack-and-upkeep/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-08T14:22:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/on-slack-time</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>A term I hear often in the context of engineering and project management
is “slack.” It’s often used to refer to a magical pool of time that all
of a service’s upkeep, including maintenance and operations, is going to
come out of. This is wrong though. Here’s why:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>That’s not what slack is for</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mismanaged slack is equivalent to non-existent slack</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-it-then">What is it then?</h2>

<p>I subscribe to the definition in
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0767907698">Tom DeMarco’s Slack</a>,
which is “the degree of freedom required to effect change.”</p>

<p>Slack is something you maintain so that your team is responsive and adaptable,
it is <em>not</em> “extra time” or “maintenance time.” If you are doing this, you are
effectively allocating that time and thus <em>eliminating your slack pool.</em> Signs
you or your team may be guilty of this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You don’t make explicit allocations of time to operations or
maintenance upkeep</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You don’t “have enough time” to properly operate or maintain your
services</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can’t solve problems or complete remediation items identified by your
organization’s problem management program</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="so-i-should-do-nothing-then">So I should do nothing then?</h2>

<p>Well, no. At least <em>some</em> of your slack needs to be spent idle though.
Remember that the concept of slack is rooted in queueing theory. There’s
a well-known relationship between utilization and response time. This
relationship is <em>exponential:</em> The higher utilized your team is, the
<em>much</em> higher your response time is! You can see it for yourself
below:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.charleshooper.net/images/posts/util_response_rel.png" alt="Relationship between utilization and response time" /></p>

<p>We can tell by looking at this graph that our responsiveness falls apart
at about 70% utilization which means you should keep at least 30% of
your time <em>unallocated</em>.</p>

<h2 id="unallocated-why-cant-i-just-devote-30-of-my-time-to-upkeep">Unallocated? Why can’t I just devote 30% of my time to upkeep?</h2>

<p>Because upkeep, the maintenance and operations of your service,
are <em>required</em> activities. Entropy means that, unkept, your service will
degrade over time. This entropy is accelerated if your service is
experiencing growth. Your databases will bloat, your latency will
increase, your 99.99% success rate will fall to 99.9% (or worse), your
service will be difficult to add features to, and eventually your users
will go somewhere else.</p>

<p>Instead of thinking about it like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.charleshooper.net/images/posts/slack_wrong_way.png" alt="Wrong way to manage slack" /></p>

<p>Think about it like <em>this</em>:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.charleshooper.net/images/posts/slack_right_way.png" alt="Right way to manage slack" /></p>

<p>In this model, you explicitly allocate time to upkeep <em>and</em> maintain a
slack pool.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-time-should-i-spend-on-upkeep-versus-product-and-feature-work">How much time should I spend on upkeep versus product and feature work?</h2>

<p>I don’t have a good guideline for you, sorry. You’ll need to determine
this based on your organization’s or team’s goals and any SLAs you may
have.</p>

<p>For example, if you’re operating a service with a service-level
objective of meeting a 99.99% success rate (0.01% error rate) then you
need to allocate more time to upkeep than a service targetting a 99.9%
success rate, generally speaking.</p>

<p>Note that this will change and vary over time. If you’re already deep in
technical debt, your upkeep allocation will need to be much higher to
pay off some of your principal. Once you’ve done that, you’ll probably
be able to meet your goals with a much lower allocation later on.</p>

<h2 id="call-to-action">Call to action</h2>

<p>I urge everyone to start thinking about slack and upkeep this way. Take a
close look at your team’s goals and commitments and explicitly allocate time
for reaching those goals. Doing so will allow your team to properly maintain
the services which it operates while
also being very responsive.</p>

    <link href="http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/what-i-do-sre/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-21T06:02:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/what-i-do-as-an-sre</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>Sometimes people ask me what I do and I’m not really sure how to answer
them. My answer tends to depend on social setting, what I’ve been
working on, and if I was on call that week. No matter the circumstances,
it usually comes out pretty boring and terribly short.</p>

<p>This really sucks though, because I actually really <em>like</em> my job and
think that it’s interesting, if only I could articulate it.</p>

<p>So here’s some attempt at explaining what I do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I’m an SRE, or <em>Service Reliability Engineer</em>,
at <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. Typically, SRE stands for <em>Site</em>
Reliability Engineer, however we’ve modernized it at Heroku because what
is even a site anymore?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My week-to-week is wildly unpredictable. This week I’m conducting an
operational review of one of our key platform components, last week I
was investigating and addressing database bloat, and the week before I
was the on-call incident commander and quite busy due to several
incidents that occurred.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking of the incident commander role, part of my job includes
<em>defining</em> how we respond to incidents. At first glance it seems easy:
Get paged and show up. And then you respond to your first 24-hour
slow-burning incident and realize that you’ve got more work to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following incidents, I also schedule and faciliate retrospectives. We
practice <a href="http://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/">blameless
postmortems</a>
and these tend to be incredibly constructive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also analyze past incident data and look for patterns and trends.
Wondering if there’s a day of week that has a higher probability of
experiencing an incident? Yeah, it’s Friday.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When all is quiet, I review dashboards and investigate anomolies.
Wondering what that weird spike or dip is that seems to happen every
once in a while? Ask me, I’ve probably pulled that thread before (and if
I haven’t, I’ll be terribly curious).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And sometimes I build integration tests and tools. I wrote
<a href="http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/troubleshooting-elbs-with-elbping/">elbping</a>, for instance,
because ELBs were terrible to troubleshoot during an incident.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And, most importantly, I mentor other SREs and software engineers.
This is the single biggest thing I can do in terms of its impact, and
probably most rewarding, too.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So there you have it, that’s what I do.</p>

    <updated>2013-10-26T09:52:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/actual-emails-from-a-recruiter</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>OK, I was going to lead up to this carefully so this didn’t seem like yet
another awful blog post about technical recruiters (can we seriously stop
posting those?) but I have no words. Here is the fifth email sent from one
particular recruiter inside of a week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey Charles,</p>

  <p>I hope all is well man!  I hadn’t heard back from you after my previous
e-mail so I was toying around with putting together a search party to make
sure you didn’t fall into a well or something.  I’m not sure if that actually
even happens anymore but this dog came up to me on my way to work and was
barking at me in a way that seemed he was attempting to tell me something.</p>

  <p>Naturally, I put two and two together and realized that perhaps I
misunderstood my new furry friend and instead of saying “Chance is in danger”
he said “Charles is in danger”.  Which still doesn’t shed light on the where
abouts of my missing cat Chance, but if you are in fact in danger, don’t
hesitate to let me know.  I can hold my breath for 45 seconds (not that long)
and I can run fast-ish for short distances.  I also have this thing with
blood where I “pass out”.</p>

  <p>On second thought, if your in danger you should probably just call 911 or
yell “fire” (I guess “help” doesn’t work for some reason).  However, if
you’re even remotely interested in discussing the possibility of chatting
about new opportunities, I’m your guy!  Hope to hear from you soon Charles!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yuuuuup.</p>

    <link href="http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/troubleshooting-elbs-with-elbping/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-19T10:49:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/troubleshooting-elbs-with-elbping</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>Troubleshooting ELBs can be pretty painful at times because they are
largely a black box. There aren’t many metrics available, and the ones
that do exist are aggregated across all of the nodes of an ELB. This can
be troublesome at times, for example when only a subset of an ELB’s
nodes are degraded.</p>

<h1 id="elb-properties">ELB Properties</h1>

<p>ELBs have some interesting properties. For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ELBs are made up of 1 or more nodes</li>
  <li>These nodes are published as A records for the ELB name</li>
  <li>These nodes can fail, or be shut down, and connections will <em>not</em> be closed gracefully</li>
  <li>It often requires a good relationship with Amazon support ($$$) to get someone to dig into ELB problems</li>
</ul>

<p><em>NOTE: Another interesting property but slightly less pertinent is that
ELBs were not designed to handle sudden spikes of traffic. They
typically require 15 minutes of heavy traffic before they will scale up
or they can be pre-warmed on request via a support ticket</em></p>

<h1 id="troubleshooting-elbs-manually">Troubleshooting ELBs (manually)</h1>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>Since writing this blog post, AWS has since migrated all
ELBs to use Route 53 for DNS. In addition, all ELBs now have a
<code>all.$elb_name</code> record that will return the full list of nodes for the
ELB. For example, if your ELB name is
<code>elb-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com</code>, then you would get the full
list of nodes by doing something like <code>dig
all.elb-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com</code>. In addition, Route 53 is
able to return up to 4KB of data still using UDP, so using the <code>+tcp</code>
flag may not be necessary.</em></p>

<p>Knowing this, you can do a little bit of troubleshooting on your own.
First, resolve the ELB name to a list of nodes (as A records):</p>

<pre><code>$ dig @ns-942.amazon.com +tcp elb-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com ANY
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>tcp</code> flag is suggested as your ELB could have too many records to fit
inside of a single UDP packet. You also need to perform an <code>ANY</code> query because
Amazon’s nameservers will only return a subset of the nodes otherwise.  Running
this command will give you output that looks something like this (trimmed for
brevity):</p>

<pre><code>;; ANSWER SECTION:
elb-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com. 60 IN SOA ns-942.amazon.com. root.amazon.com. 1376719867 3600 900 7776000 60
elb-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com. 600 IN NS ns-942.amazon.com.
elb-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com. 60 IN A 54.243.63.96
elb-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com. 60 IN A 23.21.73.53
</code></pre>

<p>Now, for each of the <code>A</code> records use e.g. <code>curl</code> to test a connection to
the ELB. Of course, you also want to isolate your test to just the ELB
without connecting to your backends. One final property and little known
fact about ELBs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The maximum size of the request method (verb) that can be sent through an ELB is <strong>127 characters</strong>. Any larger and the ELB will reply with an <em>HTTP 405 - Method not allowed</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that we can take advantage of this behavior to test only that
the ELB is responding:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -X $(python -c 'print "A" * 128') -i http://ip.of.individual.node
HTTP/1.1 405 METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED
Content-Length: 0
Connection: Close
</code></pre>

<p>If you see <code>HTTP/1.1 405 METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED</code> then the ELB is responding
successfully. You might also want to adjust curl’s timeouts to values
that are acceptable to you.</p>

<h1 id="troubleshooting-elbs-using-elbping">Troubleshooting ELBs using elbping</h1>

<p>Of course, doing this can get pretty tedious so I’ve built a tool to
automate this called <a href="https://github.com/heroku/elbping">elbping</a>. It’s
available as a ruby gem, so if you have rubygems then you can install it
by simply doing:</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install elbping
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can run:</p>

<pre><code>$ elbping -c 4 http://elb-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
Response from 54.243.63.96: code=405 time=210 ms
Response from 23.21.73.53: code=405 time=189 ms
Response from 54.243.63.96: code=405 time=191 ms
Response from 23.21.73.53: code=405 time=188 ms
Response from 54.243.63.96: code=405 time=190 ms
Response from 23.21.73.53: code=405 time=192 ms
Response from 54.243.63.96: code=405 time=187 ms
Response from 23.21.73.53: code=405 time=189 ms
--- 54.243.63.96 statistics ---
4 requests, 4 responses, 0% loss
min/avg/max = 187/163/210 ms
--- 23.21.73.53 statistics ---
4 requests, 4 responses, 0% loss
min/avg/max = 188/189/192 ms
--- total statistics ---
8 requests, 8 responses, 0% loss
min/avg/max = 188/189/192 ms
</code></pre>

<p>Remember, if you see <code>code=405</code> then that means that the ELB is responding.</p>

<p>Whichever method you choose, you will at least know if your ELB’s nodes
are responding or not. Armed with this knowledge, you can either turn
your focus to troubleshooting other parts of your stack or be able to
make a pretty reasonable case to AWS that something is wrong.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

    <id>http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/my-def-con-21-experience</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>I’ve just returned from <a href="https://www.defcon.org/">DEF CON</a> this year and wanted to share my
experience. I’ve only been to DEF CON one other time which I believe was
DEF CON 16. During DEF CON 16, I mostly stuck to the hallway track and,
to be perfectly honest, didn’t get alot out of it as I mostly hung out
with coworkers.</p>

<p>This time around I went with my good friend Japhy and no one else.</p>

<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>

<p>We flew in separately on Thursday and stayed in the Bellagio. We
initially chose the Bellagio because it was cheaper and we didn’t think
a 15 minute walk every day was going to be a big deal. As it turns out,
the walk itself was fine (even with the 98F weather) but it meant we
were effectively separated from the conference for most of the day. I
think the next time I go I would like to stay in the same hotel as the
conference.</p>

<h2 id="thursday">Thursday</h2>

<p>Thursday was my day of travel. The flight was late leaving SFO but this
isn’t unusual as planes to/from SFO are pretty much ever on time it
seems. Blame the fog.</p>

<p>Anyways, I arrived mid-afternoon and just hung out around the Bellagio
since Japhy wasn’t in yet. I ate some pho, drank some good bourbon, and
played some video poker. Eventually, Japhy arrived and we grabbed a beer
together before turning in.</p>

<h2 id="friday">Friday</h2>

<p>Friday morning we woke up and went and get our badges. They were pretty
sweet looking and I was curious about the crypto challenge. There was
apparently a talk where the badges were explained but I missed that and
so I mostly chatted with random people about them and compared notes and
hypothesis. My badge, the Ace of Phones, translated to “in the real
order the”. There was also an XOR gate on it but I never got far enough
to know what it was for.</p>

<p>Badges aside, Friday is the day that I went to the most talks.</p>

<p>The first talk I went to was about <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-21/dc-21-speakers.html#Caudill">Offensive Forensics</a>. The speaker
asserted that an attacker could use many of the same techniques that
would be used by a forensics investigator during their attack. For
example, an attacker could easily recover and steal files that were
previously deleted. The talk was good but I felt that the speaker spent
too much time trying to convince the audience that it was a good idea.
My personal opinion, and that of the people I’ve talked to, all seemed
to agree up front that it was a great idea.</p>

<p>After leaving this talk I ended up catching the tail end of
<a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-21/dc-21-speakers.html#Alecu">Business Logic Flaws In Mobile Operators Services</a>. I wish I saw
more of this, but the speaker more or less explained that many mobile
operator services have big flaws in their business logic (just like the
title, eh?) such as relying on Caller ID for authentication. He also
gave a live demo of an (unnamed) customer service line that, instead of
disconnecting you on the third entry of an invalid PIN, actually grants
you access.</p>

<p>Next I caught the end of <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-21/dc-21-speakers.html#Bowne">Evil DoS Attacks and Strong Defenses</a> where
Matt Prince (CEO of CloudFlare) described some very large DDoS attacks
and what they looked like. Someone afterwards also showed a variety of
online banking websites where the “logout” button doesn’t actually do
anything, leaving users vulnerable.</p>

<p>Immediately following that session, two guys got up and gave their talk
on <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-21/dc-21-speakers.html#Miu">Kill ‘em All — DDoS Protection Total Annihilation!</a>. I enjoyed
the format of the talk, where the speakers would describe DDoS
protection techniques and then how to bypass them. The bottom line is:
a) look like a real client, b) perform whatever handshakes are necessary
(alot of DDoS mitigators rely on odd protocol behaviors), c) use the OS
TCP/IP stack when mossible (see (a) and (b)), do what it takes to bypass
any front-end caches, and d) try to keep your attack threshold just
below where anyone will notice you.</p>

<p>At night, there were a bunch of DEF CON parties. At some point the fire
alarm went off a few times. A voice came over the intercom shortly after
stating that they weren’t sure <em>why</em> their alarm system entered test
mode but that “the cause was being investigated.” Later, it happened
again and the hallway strobes for the fire alarm stayed on, adding kind
of a cool effect to the party. Hmm.</p>

<h2 id="saturday">Saturday</h2>

<p>On Saturday I only saw two talks.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Wireless village - In the wireless village I listened to a Q&amp;A
session by a pen tester whose expertise was in wireless assessments. My
favorite quote from this talk was:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Q: When you do these wireless assessments, is your goal just to
get onto the network or do you look at wireless devices, such as
printers, as well?</p>

      <p>A: I pulled 700 bank accounts from a financial institution 6 weeks
ago [during a pen test]. We like printers.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Skytalks - One of the skytalks I saw the first half of was about “big
data”, the techniques used in analyzing this data, their weaknesses, and
how you could use these techniques to stay below the radar so to speak.
It was interesting but rather abstract and I’m not totally certain how
to apply that in practice.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For the rest of the day, I brought my laptop and just kind of tinkered
with stuff.</p>

<h2 id="sunday">Sunday</h2>

<p>I flew home early Sunday morning so I didn’t do anything on this day.</p>

    <link href="http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/why-i-moved-to-san-francisco/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-21T00:33:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/why-i-moved-to-san-francisco</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>It’s been three months since I first moved to San Francisco and decided
I should share why I moved here in the first place. The primary reasons
why I moved to San Francisco are for my career and to be around more
like-minded people.</p>

<p>Career-wise, what made San Francisco appealing to me is the number and
diversity of employment opportunities. In Connecticut, if you want to
work with “technology” then you work for one of the many insurance
companies headquartered there or an agency of some kind. In addition to
available opportunities, there is also more parity between the job
market in the bay area and my skill set and experience. For example,
today <a href="http://www.indeed.com/">Indeed.com</a> reports 184 results for the “Python” in the entire
state of Connecticut, while there are nearly 2,700 results for the San
Francisco Bay Area. At one point in my life, I was told I was wasting my
life messing around with GNU/Linux and other Open Source software.
Things would have been a little better if I moved two hours away to
either Boston or New York, but if I’m going to move then I might as well
get better weather out of it, too.</p>

<p>I also moved to San Francisco to be around more like-minded people.
Things that interest me (besides gardening and home brewing) are
startups and tech. There were a few groups around my old location that
were interesting, but they typically required an hour long drive to show
up to their events. Often times, the groups failed early due to a lack
of participation (including the hackerspace I founded but that story is
for another day).</p>

<h2 id="thoughts-so-far">Thoughts so far</h2>

<p>As I mentioned, I’ve now been here for three months. My thoughts so far
are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The place really is quite small. Especially in tech. Everyone seems to
know everyone, which can be fun socially, but you need to watch what
you say when you’re talking shop.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Sillicon Valley/SF Bay tech isolation chamber is real (and so is
the echo chamber). Companies sometimes seem huge when you’re in the
bay, but if you talk to anyone from outside of the area, they’re like
“<em>Who?</em>”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>San Francisco’s neighborhoods are really awesome. SF
is divided into a bunch of small neighborhoods, each with their own
unique attributes. There really is a place for everyone.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I moved to San Francisco because I thought it would be good for my
career and because I thought I would meet more like-minded people. This
has certainly proved to be the case. What I was not expecting but have
experienced so far is how small and isolated the SF tech scene actually
is.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How I Hacked My High School]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/how-i-hacked-my-high-school/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-18T10:59:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/how-i-hacked-my-high-school</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>When I was a freshman or sophomore in high school, I cracked my high
school and got in “a lot of trouble” for it. I’ve only told the story
maybe half a dozen times in my life, but after telling it a few times in
the past month or so, I decided to write about.</p>

<p>I went to a high school in a fairly decent school district that
apparently had enough money to build several computer labs in each
school, network them all together as a single autonomous network, and
provide reasonably fast Internet access. This was somewhere between the
year 1999 and the year 2000, the exact year I can’t quite remember.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing to note about my high school was that it
carried with it an 80-hour community service requirement for graduation.
I’ve always been into computers and networking
so it was natural for me volunteer to do my community service assisting
the technical staff in the computer labs. Community service in this way
typically involved installing printer drivers, updating software, and
pushing boxes around on a cart.</p>

<p>My school’s computer network consisted of a mix of sevaral flavors of
Windows including Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT 4.0. Despite
the large Microsoft-only network, we were using Novell for
authentication and authorization. Each school in the district was
networked together and part of this same Novell network.</p>

<p>My school had reasonable filtering and monitoring in place for web
traffic and it wasn’t uncommon to hear of students getting into trouble
for looking at, let’s say “questionable content.”</p>

<p>One weird thing my school did was restrict access to the local hard
drive. If you went into Explorer, the <code>C:\</code> volume simply wasn’t listed.
This was supposedly because we were supposed to use our network-attached
“S drive” which was unique to each user. The “Run” dialog from the Start
menu was also disabled.</p>

<p>This had its flaws; however, and one day I hand-wrote (in English class)
a 6 page paper detailing the variety of ways even an unskilled person
could bypass this precaution. Most notably this included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a shortcut on the desktop to <code>C:\</code></li>
  <li>Open internet explorer and browse to <code>file:///...</code></li>
  <li>Certain “Save As” and “Open” dialogs still listed the C-drive and was browsable</li>
  <li>You could still get to a “Run” dialog by opening the task manager and finding it in there. This allowed you to a) Browse to the C-drive anyway, and b) Open up a command prompt</li>
</ul>

<p>There were probably some other flaws I missed. I argued that restricting
access to the local disk was rather pointless as people could simply
drop to it during boot (which many students were already doing in order
to get a kick out of doing <code>deltree C:\Windows</code> for some reason) and
that the real issue was that local password caching was enabled. In
other words, whenever a user logged in, a hashed version of their
password was stored in the form of a windows “PWL file.”</p>

<p>The next time I did my community service, I handed my paper to the head
technician which he responded “What? This could never happen”
and threw my paper in the garbage.</p>

<p>What?! I couldn’t believe that someone would actually throw away what
was, at the time, the longest paper I’ve ever written after barely
having read it. And to do this with a 4-word response no less!</p>

<p>Due to my shock and what was apparent lack of maturity, I decided
that I would show them. I mean, when you approach someone with what you
think is an obvious, logical opinion and they don’t believe you, your
next option is to show them, right? <em>Right?</em></p>

<p>It didn’t take me too long to gather up a fairly large collection of
these so-called “PWL files” on a floppy disk. Distinguishing between
staff and students was trivial too due to the naming convention in
place. Students’ usernames were always in the form of
<code>{ExpectedGraduationYear}{LastName}{FirstInitial}</code>. Mine was
<code>03hooperc</code>. Faculty and staff, on the other hand, simply followed the
convention <code>{FirstInitial}{LastName}</code>. I decided that I didn’t care for
any of the student logins and just discarded them.</p>

<p>When I had a good collection of staff PWL files, I used a tool called
<a href="http://www.oxid.it/cain.html">Cain &amp; Abel</a> on my home computer and ran it overnight.</p>

<p>In the morning, I was surprised to see how many passwords were cracked.
Among them, one staff login stuck out at me. It was the technician who
threw my paper out. I knew that because, unlike the rest of the
technical staff, he mostly worked on network issues, he must have alot
more access than anyone else. His password was hilariously bad and
insecure. It consisted of two three-letter words in all caps:</p>

<pre><code>THEMAN
</code></pre>

<p>The man, huh? I giggled and went to school ready to launch my next
attack. I went to the computer lab during lunch and waited for the
opportunity to log into my new staff account. I had to be careful,
though, as my school set the background of staff accounts to something
very noticable and I didn’t want the computer lab attendant sitting in
the back to notice that I was on an account that didn’t belong to me. At
some point, she left briefly and I quickly logged onto The Man’s
account.</p>

<p>Once I was logged in, I was more in excited and nervous than
anything. Even still, I moved onto the next step of creating a backdoor
account with admin privileges. I made up a name and created a new
account following the faculty/staff naming convention and granted it
every privilege I could. As soon as I was done, I logged off. The
log-off couldn’t be slower. I felt like Peter in Office Space when he’s
trying to duck out of work early and his computer keeps coming up with
a bunch of last-minute tasks before it can log off.</p>

<p>I logged into my backdoor account exactly once to verify that it worked
and never logged into it again. I fucked up and made the classic mistake
of telling a friend. He was one of the few people I knew who also used
Linux and we used to trade books, CDs, and manuals all the time. My
favorite trade was giving him <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6527">Debian GNU/Linux: Guide to Installation and Usage</a>
for a manual from Bell Canada about this crazy thing called SONET and
T-carrier transmission systems (e.g., T-1 lines). Who knew that I would
one day work for an ISP and later move on to manage thousands of Linux
hosts based on a Debian derivative?</p>

<p>Some months later, I start hearing from other students that my buddy has
told a bunch of people my secret and has even been logging into the
account to prove it (OK, I definitely shouldn’t have shared the
credentials!) I decided that the best thing to do in this case was to
confess to the Director of Information Technology, who I used to bug
from time to time and ask why we didn’t use Linux since it’s free (Yes,
I was probably a very annoying fifteen year old) For those wondering, he
said it was because of a “licensing issue” which I think was
professional speak for “fuck off, kid”). So, I walked into his office
one day and dropped the bomb.</p>

<p>I honestly don’t know what I was expecting to happen. He listened to my
story, asked me how long I had this access for. When I told him, he
remarked that their backups didn’t back that far and that, in any case,
he’d have to report me to the administration. He walked me over to the
dean of disclipline’s office and I went through a grueling session of
more questions.</p>

<p>Something I should probably note is that this during a period where a
bunch of schools, including mine, had decided to institute a
so-called “zero tolerance policy.” What these zero-tolerance policies
were was simply a matrix of “Violations” on one axis and
“Number of prior offenses” on the other. In other words, getting caught
smoking in the bathroom for the first time carried a pre-determined
penalty which was slightly less bad than getting caught doing that for
the second time. Students could never argue that they didn’t know they
would get in so much trouble for anything because this matrix and every
other school/district policy was distributed to us at the beginning of
the year and we were required to have it on us at all times.</p>

<p>The obvious flaw with this policy, besides the fact that it ignores
additional circumstances, is that in 1999 there wasn’t a row describing
the penalties for any of the things I had done. In fact, I hadn’t
technically violated any of the school or district policies at all!
(Federal and local crimes may be another issue). I was sent home with
the dean of discipline still deciding what to do with me, but I figured
I was probably going to be suspended for a few days.</p>

<p>I went home and told my parents what happened and, very very <em>very</em>
surprisingly, they said I did the right thing (albeit many months late).
Something else amazing happened though. My parents called the school
and, after talking to the dean, we learned that my school was actually
considering <strong>expulsion!</strong> My parents made some phone calls and tried to
pull some strings that we didn’t think we had but ultimately told me that
we wouldn’t know my fate until the next day at school.</p>

<p>The next day I went into school and was immediately called into the
dean’s office. He explained that they had decided that what I was guilty
of stealing and kept using this “stole the key to the bank” metaphor. He
actually told me that had I not brought the password files home on a
floppy disk, I would probably be in less trouble. What the fuck?</p>

<p>And then I received my sentencing: Ten day suspension.</p>

<p>Ten days! That was <em>huge</em>. For comparison:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ten days in the maximum amount of time you could be suspended for. Anything longer would be considered an expulsion and would require a hearing of some kind.</li>
  <li>You could punch someone in the face (you know, assault) and the punishment for doing that would be 4-6 days… on the second offense.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t remember how I got home but it was like my parents weren’t even
mad. In fact, they seemed more proud than anything. I think they even
thought that this incident would get me hired somewhere someday, too.</p>

<p>After my suspension, I returned to school to learn that, in addition to
my now-served suspension, I was no longer allowed to use any of the
computers at school. This lasted over a year and, after signing a paper
agreeing to let my school sue me if I commit another offence, I was
given my computer access back.</p>

<p>I’m terrible at concluding stories so… The End.</p>

    <updated>2013-07-04T11:27:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/my-personal-kaizen</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>Kaizen is Japenese for “good change” or “improvement” and is frequently
used within the context of lean manufacturing. Today though, I’m going
to talk about a few things I want to improve for myself, both personally
and professionally.</p>

<h2 id="hard-skills">Hard Skills</h2>

<p>I’m fascinated by new technology and new ways of doing work, so
polishing up on some of my so-called “hard skills” comes relatively
natural to me. Things like learning a new programming language or a new
tool require only time which I’m more than willing and able to invest.
Without further ado, here are the hard skills I’d like to improve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Become proficient in <strong>Go</strong>. I find Go very appealing as a
language, specifically for systems-level uses.</li>
  <li>Become proficient in <strong>Ruby</strong>. Alot of the software I’m
responsible for maintaining at Heroku is written in Ruby.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Become proficient in a <strong>functional programming language</strong>,
such as <strong>Erlang</strong>. I’ve been interested in learning a functional
programming language for a while. I decided on Erlang after hearing a
talk from <a href="http://christophermeiklejohn.com/">Chris Meiklejohn</a> (of Basho) about Riak and watching
several talks about Erlang and Erlang/OTP.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="soft-skills">Soft Skills</h2>

<p>Addressing soft skills is something that’s a little more difficult for
me, but something that I think is important. These are the soft skills I’d
like to improve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Become better at <strong>empathy</strong>. Sometimes when listening to someone,
it’s easy to jump to conclusions about what they are trying to say or
how they came to that point. What I have been working on, however, is
understanding <em>why</em> they feel a certain way in particular.</li>
  <li>Become a <strong>better listener</strong>. I have been working on this for a while,
but one area I would still like to improve is learning to ask the the right
questions. I’m always impressed when someone follows up something I
said with an engaging question, and I would love to gain that ability.</li>
  <li>Become more <strong>well-spoken</strong>. I’d like to be a better public speaker,
both publicly and privately.</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2013-06-22T11:58:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/about-this-site-technical</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>I was playing around with my site today and realized that I hadn’t
disclosed much about how it works. Here’s that nerd “look at my site
architecture you guys” post.</p>

<p>If you couldn’t tell by the default theme, my blogging software of
choice is <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, which generates my site’s HTML from Markdown.
I use <code>vim</code> for most of my editing and do so on my Lenovo Thinkpad X220
running Ubuntu desktop. I use a tiling window manager called <a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">Awesome
WM</a>.</p>

<p>I also use <a href="http://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a> for my caching layer. For the purposes of this
dicussion, let’s just call Fastly “varnish as a service.”</p>

<p>Prior to today, I just used a single <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=2fce38a23c4154c3a1abb4f99aafd6371ee78ecc">Linode</a> in the Newark, NJ datacenter
as my web server. The Linode runs Ubuntu server and serves static HTML
with <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a>.</p>

<p>As of today, though, I’m experimenting with <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku US</a> and have
configured my Heroku clone of the site as a second backend server for
Fastly. Octopress does some magic here by serving the HTML through
<a href="http://rack.github.io/">Rack</a>, a minimal webserver for ruby.</p>

<p>My site is also monitored by <a href="http://www.pingdom.com/">Pingdom</a> and I use <a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/">Munin</a> for
metrics collection.</p>

<p>There are some really amazing takeaways from this. For one, my only
expense currently is the roughly $20/mo I pay for the <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=2fce38a23c4154c3a1abb4f99aafd6371ee78ecc">Linode</a>. I
would happily pay for any of these services for a real, money-making
website but, for this site, I’ll continue to use the free plans.</p>

<p>Second is how much technology is available to us these days. I own
<em>zero</em> physical infrastructure and the only thing slightly resembling
traditional infrastructure is my Linode. Contrast this to several years
ago when I had a third generation HP Proliant DL380 colocated and was
starting to experiment with virtualization. I mean, holy shit, you can
literally host a website for nothing!</p>

<p>This second point is why I think I love working in the PaaS
(platform-as-a-service) space so much. PaaS is still young enough that
many skeptics don’t believe it’s a working model. I think we’ve proven
that it works, now we just need to prove we can grow with the needs of
our customers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="section"></h1>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Moved to San Francisco</li>
  <li>Took time off to decompress</li>
  <li>Joined team at Heroku</li>
  <li>Loving it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="code--verbosecode"><code>--verbose</code></h2>

<p>It’s been a while since I’ve posted, but I wanted to let you know that
I’m still alive! Things were very hectic due to a few life changes but I
much of the dust has settled now and I’m excited to talk about what
those changes are.</p>

<p>But first, some history.</p>

<p>In 2011, I was a junior at university studying Business
Information Systems. I had some prior systems engineering and operations
experience and was paying my tuition by performing contract work for a
company that doesn’t exist today. While at this company, I worked very
closely with a developer and the two of us were responsible for running
this company’s infrastructure. Neither of us had the time or the
willpower to be bothered by operational tasks, so we automated
everything. Even though our environment was much smaller (somewhere
between 30-50 instances in EC2) than many others, we had alot of things
that many companies are lacking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New services were in configuration management</li>
  <li>New deployments were almost entirely automated</li>
  <li>We had good visibility with a variety of metrics being reported to Ganglia and Graphite</li>
  <li>We even had a reasonable nagios configuration</li>
</ul>

<p>Around this time, the term <strong>devops</strong> was being tossed around on twitter
on a more frequent basis. I can remember actually having a Google Alert
for the term to email me when there were new blog posts about it and it
<em>not</em> being spammy. I have a love/hate relationship with the term, and
in December 2011 I wrote my blog post <a href="http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/concurrent-engineering-the-foundation-of-devops/">Concurrent Engineering: The
Foundation of DevOps</a> in which I argued that the ideas behind devops
weren’t new, but were maybe old ideas from business that were recently
independtly re-discovered.</p>

<p>The blog post wasn’t very popular, but Solomon Hykes (CEO of dotCloud)
managed to see it and, thinking we had very similar ideas about devops,
invited me to interview for a position on their newly formed Site
Reliability Engineering team. I got the job at dotCloud, and up until
April of this year that’s where I stayed.</p>

<p>In mid-April, I resigned from my position at dotCloud and moved to San
Francisco. There were a number of reasons for the resignation but chief
among them was that I needed some time to decompress and all of my paid
time-off had been used up following my youngest brother’s car accident.
This ended up being an awesome decision because it gave me my
much-needed decompression time and I was able to explore my new city.</p>

<p>I took about four weeks off before I put any real effort towards a job
search. The move to San Francisco and the job search alone could fill
two entirely-too-verbose blog posts but the end result was that I moved
here safely and joined the team at <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>!</p>

<p>Fast forward to today and I’ve just finished my third week at Heroku.
It’s an amazing experience, a great team, and an awesome culture that is
encapsulated in the following quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I like our culture. We welcome failure into our house and then kick
its teeth in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ll write more about this another time. For now, thank you for
listening to my story.</p>

<p>— Charles</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="section"></h1>

<p><em>I’m writing a series of blog posts for managers and other people
without an operations background in order to introduce certain best
practices regarding Operations. For the rest of the blog posts, please

<p>Collecting metrics is another area that many early stage startups seem
to overlook even though it is probably one of the most important things
they can do. By metrics collection, I am referring to the gathering and
storing of various metrics at several different levels. As John Allspaw
identifies them in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Web-Operations-Keeping-Data-Time/dp/1449377440">Web Operations: Keeping the Data on Time</a>, they
are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>High-level business and application metrics</strong> (e.g. user sign-ups)</li>
  <li><strong>Feature-specific application-level metrics</strong> (e.g. widgets processed)</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Systems and service-level metrics</strong> (e.g. server load or database queries per second)</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll note that there are two levels of “application-level” metrics.
The higher-level application metrics are mostly those that can be tied
to business objectives, while the other category of application metrics
are generally more feature specific.</p>

<p>Benefits incurred by collecting these metrics are plentiful. For one,
having quick access to these metrics is helpful during troubleshooting
and incident response. For example, I was once hired under contract to
look into why a certain company’s API was unreliable for the previous
few months. At least once per day, this company’s API would time out and
not respond to client requests. After enabling basic metrics collection
for the servers and services used by the API, it very quickly became
obvious that the database servers were reaching their connection limits
which was preventing the API from retrieving records from the database.
Not only was this problem identified very quickly, but later on we were
able to look back at our metrics data to assess how close to our limits
we were getting.</p>

<p>Another benefit is that you can integrate the metrics into your
<a href="http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/intro-to-ops-availability-monitoring-alerting/">Availability monitoring</a> system to be alerted when metrics surpass
some threshold or change significantly. Not only that, but analyzing
these metrics will allow you to manage your capacity intelligently and
build a business case to justify infrastructure expenditures. Finally,
analyzing these metrics will also give you insight into your
application, how it’s used, and your business.</p>

<p>How you go about collecting and storing these metrics is up to you. Many
engineers might be tempted to build their own solution; however, there
are many open source and third party software packages that you may find
helpful. Key considerations when choosing which package or packages to
use are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ability to add new, custom metrics</li>
  <li>Configurable resolution/storage trade-off</li>
  <li>Integration with availability monitoring and alerting systems</li>
  <li>Graphing/visualization</li>
</ul>

<p>If your startup doesn’t have any metrics then you should start
collecting them now. The visualization will help you in the short run
and the historical data will help you in the long run.</p>

<p><em>I’m writing a series of blog posts for managers and other people

<p>Another area I’ve seen alot of early stage startups lacking in is
<strong>availability monitoring and alerting</strong>. The essence of availability
monitoring and alerting is being notified when your service is not
working as expected, including when it’s simply down, isn’t meeting
formal or informal SLAs (e.g., it’s too slow), or certain functionality
is broken.</p>

<p>What I typically see is that some effort was made to set up this type of
monitoring before and never maintained. Symptoms include <em>poor
monitoring coverage</em> (<em>servers missing from the config, services
monitoring nearly non-existent</em>), <em>large amounts of false positives and
negatives</em>, <em>inactionable alerts</em>, and <em>alerts that go unignored</em>
because of the previous issues.</p>

<p>Symptoms on the business include not knowing when your service is down
and finding out that your service is broken <em>from your customers</em>.
Finding out that your service is down from your customers is not only
embarrassing but it also shakes their confidence in you, affects your
reputation, and may even lead to lost revenue.</p>

<p>The good news is that it doesn’t have to be this way. When availability
monitoring is set up properly, maintained, and you and your employees
agree to approach alerts a specific way, you will be able to reap a
variety of benefits. Here’s what I recommend:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, collaborate with your employees to define who is in the pager
  rotation and the escalation policies. Ask yourself: What happens when
  the on call engineer is overwhelmed and needs backup? What happens when
  the engineer goes on vacation?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next, take inventory of what services you rely on and define an
  internal SLA for them. This does not have to be a super formal process,
  but this inventory and SLA will be helpful for deciding what thresholds
  to set in your monitoring to avoid false positives. Try to see the big
  picture and think about everything such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Servers,</li>
      <li>Self-managed supporting services like web servers, databases, email services,</li>
      <li>Application functionality and features - one strategy I like is exposing a “health check” service that can be checked by the monitoring agent,</li>
      <li>Third party services like remote APIs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Your inventory and SLA definition is a living document; remember to
  keep it up to date!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Then set up whatever monitoring package you or your engineers decided
  to use (self-hosted or third party) such as <a href="http://www.nagios.org/">nagios</a>, <a href="http://www.zenoss.com/">Zenoss</a>,
  <a href="http://www.pingdom.com/">Pingdom</a>, or <a href="http://www.copperegg.com/">CopperEgg</a> and have your monitoring configured for
  those services. If you’re really good, you’ll <em>check your configuration
  into its own source control repository</em>. If you go the self-hosted
  route, it may also be worth having your monitoring server monitored
  externally.  Who’s watching the watcher indeed. </li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>Think about integrating your monitoring with a pager service such as
  <a href="http://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>. Services like PagerDuty allow you to input your pager
  rotation and then define good rules for how to contact the on call
  engineer and when to escalate should the engineer be unavailable.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>With improved monitoring and alerting in place, you may want to think
  about giving certain customers “911” access. At a previous company I
  worked at, we had a secret email address our big customers could hit
  which would <em>open a support ticket</em> and then <em>page the on call engineer</em>
  with the ticket number. If you decide to go this route; however, you’ll
  want to <em>train your customers</em> when it’s appropriate to use this power
  and how to use it most effectively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adjust alerts and fix problems as you get paged for them. Don’t care
  that a particular API goes down during a known maintenance window?
  Schedule the notification policy accordingly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, continue maintaining your inventory and monitoring
  service’s configuration. For extra benefit, consider tracking your
  organization’s <strong>Mean Time To Respond</strong> (how long it took for engineer to
  acknowledge that something is wrong) and your <strong>Mean Time To Recover</strong>
  (how long it took the engineer to resolve the issue <em>including</em> the Mean
  Time To Respond), your <strong>Mean Time Between Failures</strong> (self-explanatory,
  I hope), and <strong>Percent Availability</strong> (what percent of time your service
  is functional in a given period of time). </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This concludes the management and non-ops introduction to operations; I
hope you find this helpful.</p>

    <id>http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/intro-to-operations-configuration-management</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="section"></h1>

<p><em>I’m writing a series of blog posts for managers and other people
without an operations background in order to introduce certain best
practices regarding Operations. For the rest of the blog posts, please
visit the <a href="http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/intro-to-ops-for-startups/">introductory Intro to Operations</a> blog post!</em></p>

<p>One of the areas I’ve witnessed early stage startups lacking in is
<strong>configuration management</strong>. <em>Configuration management is the process of
standardizing and enforcing configurations</em>. In other words,
configuration management is about deciding on a specific configuration
of services for various roles and then applying these configurations in
practice. Typically, these manifests are written in (domain-specific)
language and is specific to the <em>configuration management software</em>
being used, such as <a href="https://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a>, <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">chef</a>, <a href="http://cfengine.com/">cfengine</a>, or
<a href="http://saltstack.com/community.html">salt stack</a>.</p>

<p>There are many benefits to configuration management. For one,
configuration management allows developers to spend more time working on
the product and less time deploying new services. This is because
configuration is now automated and faster as a result. In addition,
environments are standardized and therefore less time is spent
troubleshooting or diagnosing edge cases in different environments.
Finally, when coupled with <em>source control management</em>, the proper use
of configuration management can be used to track and audit what has
changed over time and who changed it.</p>

<p>In many of these early stage startups, there is either very little
configuration management performed at all, or configuration management
exists as a series of shell scripts cobbled together to do some
post-hardware setup. If you’re lucky, there exists a document somewhere
that describes when and how to run these scripts to deploy new services.</p>

<p>The way configuration management works is that engineers create a
collection of files that define how the system should be configured.
This collection of files is typically called a <strong>manifest</strong>. Then, once
physical or virtual hardware has been provisioned, one of these
manifests is <em>applied</em> to the new host. During application, the
configuration management software will interpret the new configuration,
install software packages, manage users and credentials, alter config
files, manage file permissions, run arbitrary commands, and so on. Once
the manifest is fully applied, the new host should be fully configured
and ready to be used!  In some environments; however, they may be a
post-host-provisioning step where additional work is performed
afterwards, such as checking out application code from a source control
repository.</p>

<p>If you’re not using configuration management already then you should
start now because, frankly, it’s never too early. Starting configuration
management now will not only help your first hired ops/systems engineer
from working backwards to write these manifests later, but will also
incur benefits (such as your developers spending less time away from
shipping value-added code) that will outweigh the initial learning
curve.</p>

    <id>http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/intro-to-operations-for-early-stage-startups</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>I’ve spent the last few years in a variety of roles for early stage tech
startups. While in these roles, I’ve noticed a pattern: <em>Early stage
startups don’t give much thought to their operations. In particular,
they typically don’t hire anyone specifically for that role because they
are focused on building their product.</em> In other words, all of their
technical hires are for developers.</p>

<p>What tends to happen in my experience is that <em>their developers soon
become overwhelmed</em> (especially after a growth spurt) and are unable to
spend their time shipping code that’s going to improve their product or
make their company money. Eventually, if they’re lucky, management catches
onto this and hires their first <strong>systems or operations engineer</strong>.</p>

<p>Because I’ve had the opportunity to be first-hired systems engineer,
what I’ve experienced is the effect of “working backwards” to undo a
bunch of things that weren’t done following best practices while
simultaneously moving things forward to improve them.</p>

<p>I decided to try to educate whoever would be willing to read this
(hopefully early stage startups!) about some <em>best practices</em> that will
not only save their future operations engineers some headache, but will
also improve their business. Part of this education will happen in the
form of one-on-one time with these startups. For example, I spent the
last couple of days sitting in on office hours at a startup accelerator.
The other part; however, will take place by writing “Intro to…”
articles and publishing them to a variety of places, including this blog.</p>

<p>Specifically, the topics I’ve chosen to write about are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/intro-to-ops-config-management/">Configuration management</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/intro-to-ops-availability-monitoring-alerting/">Availability monitoring</a></li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/intro-to-ops-metrics-collection/">Metrics collection</a></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>Over the next week or so, I’ll write about each one of these topics and
post them to this blog. I hope people find them helpful!</p>

    <updated>2013-01-14T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/2012-annual-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>Here are some stats from 2012:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only 3 posts published.</li>
  <li>50,791 pageviews.</li>
  <li>36,176 visitors (32,007 unique)</li>
  <li>71.97% bounce rate.</li>
  <li>Same great position at dotCloud!</li>
</ul>

<p>Interestingly, my stats compared to last year aren’t too different, despite the fact that I only wrote 3 blog posts this year (instead of 10 last year). What’s also interesting is the HUGE spike in bounce rate (which used to be almost non-existent). This spike begins right around the time I hit a “home run” in terms of driving new traffic.</p>

<p>Going forward, I am going to try to post more (<em>again</em>). I’ve said this before but have yet to succeed. This time around, I changed my posting rules to allow me to write about topics more personal to me or more opinionated in nature.</p>

    <link href="http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/year-end-highlights/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-16T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/year-end-highlights</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>Since I’ve only written 3 blog posts so far this year and alot has changed, here’s a brief summary of what I’ll be writing about in my annual review:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I stopped doing contract work and started working for dotCloud part time,</li>
  <li>As of tomorrow, I’ll officially have completed the requirements for my Bachelor’s degree,</li>
  <li>I found myself, politically (I won’t be writing about this, but it is a big deal to me).</li>
</ul>

<p>What does the future hold for me?</p>

<ul>
  <li>dotCloud offered me a full time position and I accepted; I will start January 2nd,</li>
  <li>I have a variety of side projects planned but it’s too soon to tell how much of my free time I’ll want to spend on them,</li>
  <li>I hope to become more involved with my local community and the ACM,</li>
  <li>I’ve made the decision to stop writing so much on Facebook and Twitter and write more here.</li>
</ul>

<p>That last item has big implications for this blog. It means that I’ll be writing about more personal subjects and opinions I have instead of wasting that effort on Twitter and Facebook (where relatives I haven’t seen in 20 years take the opportunities to rant on my wall). Some of these opinions may also be controversial and, that’s OK, we’re meant to disagree on some things. Some of them may even be ill-formed as they’ll be outside of my area of expertise. That’s OK too, just write me and educate me.</p>
