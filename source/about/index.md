I’m a results-driven hacker looking for an exciting company that’s solving interesting problems.

I’m looking for a role where I can collaborate with the team in order to make a large impact on the operations of a business. I believe that a business’ “operations team” doesn’t exist only to manage infrastructure and deploy software but also to contribute to the execution of the organization’s strategy. This can be accomplished by collaborating with all members of the team. For example, by collaborating with Marketing in order to develop demand forecasts, proper capacity management can be performed in coordination with feature launches and media releases. A startup, or any business for that matter, can’t afford to go down just because TechCrunch decided to write about it.

I come from an engineering and infrastructure-focused background, both “bare metal” and cloud-based, and have spent most of my time straddling the wall between operations and development. Some people call this “devops.” Most recently, I was a Site Reliability and Operations Engineer for dotCloud, a PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) provider. In general, I am well-versed in the building, running, and maintaining of distributed systems and worked closely with my team and the engineering team to increase uptime and performance.

When I’m not working or hacking, I can be found gardening and brewing my own beer.
