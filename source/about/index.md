I'm a results-driven hacker working for [Heroku][100], an exciting company
that's solving interesting problems.

  [100]: http://www.heroku.com

I'm in a role where I believe can collaborate with the team in order to
make a large impact on the operations of the business. I believe that a
business' "operations team" doesn't exist only to manage infrastructure
and deploy software but also to contribute to the execution of the
organization's strategy. This can be accomplished by collaborating with
all members of the team. For example, by collaborating with Marketing in
order to develop demand forecasts, proper capacity management can be
performed in coordination with feature launches and media releases. A
startup, or any business for that matter, can't afford to go down just
because TechCrunch decided to write about it.

I come from an engineering and infrastructure-focused background, both
"bare metal" and cloud-based, and have spent most of my time straddling
the wall between operations and development. Some people call this
"devops." Most recently, I was a Site Reliability and Operations
Engineer for dotCloud, a PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) provider. In
general, I am well-versed in the building, running, and maintaining of
distributed systems and worked closely with my team and the engineering
team to increase uptime and performance.

When I'm not working or hacking, I can be found gardening and brewing my
own beer.
