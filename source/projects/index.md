# 

*   [collectd][1]. Fork of the python collectd module adding some improvements
*   [bootleggers-maxbets][2]. This "maxbets" project was something I wrote many (circa 2007) years ago to screen-scrape and display information from a web-based mafia game
*   [recon][3]. Generate recommendations of arbitrary objects
*   [bootcrawl][4]. Crawl user profiles of players on bootleggers.us
*   [snapshot][5]. Simple shell script that takes snapshots from all installed webcams. Add to cron for best effect
*   [munin-plugins][6]. Various Munin plugins I wrote or modified
*   [markov-experimental][7]. Just me messing around with Markov chains. Includes an IRC bot
*   Cost Behavior Analysis Calculator. I wrote a web-based cost behavior analyzer, which is really just what business people call linear regressions
*   [Twitter Repeater][9]. twitter-repeater is a bot that automatically retweets any tweets in which its name is “mentioned” in
*   [RESTful SQLite Webservice][10]. ”SQLitebot” is a REST-like HTTP interface to SQLite databases
*   [Python USB I/O 24 Module][11]. Implements the Version 3 commandset for the USB I/O 24 controller board and a related relay board
*   Twitter BookSuggest. Twiter BookSuggest was a web application that made book recommendations for a person based on what they wrote about on Twitter, *now deprecated*.
