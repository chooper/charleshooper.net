Almost three years ago, I wrote a post about [moving to San Francisco][1]
and was happier than a pig in shit. Well, today I'm even more excited to
announce that *I've moved to Oregon!*

When I was between the ages and 12 and 14, my parents moved us to a very
small farm and I absolutely loved it. I had lots of space to myself,
fresh air, and animals to care for. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before
my parents lost the farm and we ended up moving back to the suburbs.

I went the rest of my life (so far :)) reminiscing about that farm and,
late last year, [Erica][2] and I started at homes. We started in the
Petaluma area but we found it a bit too expensive for what we were
looking for. We gradually continued our search further and further North
until we found the Grants Pass/Medford/Ashland, Oregon area.

We put an offer on our house in December and we finally moved in at the
beginning of February. It's been a month since then and we still wake up
every day and look out across the valley to exclaim "wow, I still can't
believe we live here!"

Around the time we put an offer on this house, I also changed jobs. I
ultimately wound up at [Stripe][3] and, if you're interested in solving
challenging problems, you should [apply to come work for us][4] :)

I'm currently assigned to the Systems team as a Site Reliability
Engineer working on how Stripe's engineering teams reliably run and
consume services at scale.

Anyway, these last three months have been amazing! I'm looking forward
to seeing what the next three bring.
