## tl;dr

* Moved to San Francisco
* Took time off to decompress
* Joined team at Heroku
* Loving it

## <code>--verbose</code>

It's been a while since I've posted, but I wanted to let you know that
I'm still alive! Things were very hectic due to a few life changes but I
much of the dust has settled now and I'm excited to talk about what
those changes are.

But first, some history.

In 2011, I was a junior at university studying Business
Information Systems. I had some prior systems engineering and operations
experience and was paying my tuition by performing contract work for a
company that doesn't exist today. While at this company, I worked very
closely with a developer and the two of us were responsible for running
this company's infrastructure. Neither of us had the time or the
willpower to be bothered by operational tasks, so we automated
everything. Even though our environment was much smaller (somewhere
between 30-50 instances in EC2) than many others, we had alot of things
that many companies are lacking:

* New services were in configuration management
* New deployments were almost entirely automated
* We had good visibility with a variety of metrics being reported to Ganglia and Graphite
* We even had a reasonable nagios configuration

Around this time, the term **devops** was being tossed around on twitter
on a more frequent basis. I can remember actually having a Google Alert
for the term to email me when there were new blog posts about it and it
*not* being spammy. I have a love/hate relationship with the term, and
in December 2011 I wrote my blog post [Concurrent Engineering: The
Foundation of DevOps][1] in which I argued that the ideas behind devops
weren't new, but were maybe old ideas from business that were recently
independtly re-discovered.

The blog post wasn't very popular, but Solomon Hykes (CEO of dotCloud)
managed to see it and, thinking we had very similar ideas about devops,
invited me to interview for a position on their newly formed Site
Reliability Engineering team. I got the job at dotCloud, and up until
April of this year that's where I stayed.

In mid-April, I resigned from my position at dotCloud and moved to San
Francisco. There were a number of reasons for the resignation but chief
among them was that I needed some time to decompress and all of my paid
time-off had been used up following my youngest brother's car accident.
This ended up being an awesome decision because it gave me my
much-needed decompression time and I was able to explore my new city.

I took about four weeks off before I put any real effort towards a job
search. The move to San Francisco and the job search alone could fill
two entirely-too-verbose blog posts but the end result was that I moved
here safely and joined the team at [Heroku][2]!

Fast forward to today and I've just finished my third week at Heroku.
It's an amazing experience, a great team, and an awesome culture that is
encapsulated in the following quote:

> I like our culture. We welcome failure into our house and then kick
its teeth in.

I'll write more about this another time. For now, thank you for
listening to my story.
