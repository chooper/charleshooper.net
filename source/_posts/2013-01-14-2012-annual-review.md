Here are some stats from 2012:

*   Only 3 posts published.
*   50,791 pageviews.
*   36,176 visitors (32,007 unique)
*   71.97% bounce rate.
*   Same great position at dotCloud!

Interestingly, my stats compared to last year aren’t too different, despite the fact that I only wrote 3 blog posts this year (instead of 10 last year). What’s also interesting is the HUGE spike in bounce rate (which used to be almost non-existent). This spike begins right around the time I hit a “home run” in terms of driving new traffic.

Going forward, I am going to try to post more (*again*). I’ve said this before but have yet to succeed. This time around, I changed my posting rules to allow me to write about topics more personal to me or more opinionated in nature.
