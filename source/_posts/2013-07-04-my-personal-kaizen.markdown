Kaizen is Japenese for "good change" or "improvement" and is frequently
used within the context of lean manufacturing. Today though, I'm going
to talk about a few things I want to improve for myself, both personally
and professionally.

## Hard Skills

I'm fascinated by new technology and new ways of doing work, so
polishing up on some of my so-called "hard skills" comes relatively
natural to me. Things like learning a new programming language or a new
tool require only time which I'm more than willing and able to invest.
Without further ado, here are the hard skills I'd like to improve:

* Become proficient in **Go**. I find Go very appealing as a
  language, specifically for systems-level uses.
* Become proficient in **Ruby**. Alot of the software I'm
  responsible for maintaining at Heroku is written in Ruby.
* Become proficient in a **functional programming language**,
  such as **Erlang**. I've been interested in learning a functional
  programming language for a while. I decided on Erlang after hearing a
  talk from [Chris Meiklejohn][1] (of Basho) about Riak and watching
  several talks about Erlang and Erlang/OTP.

## Soft Skills

Addressing soft skills is something that's a little more difficult for
me, but something that I think is important. These are the soft skills I'd
like to improve:

* Become better at **empathy**. Sometimes when listening to someone,
  it's easy to jump to conclusions about what they are trying to say or
  how they came to that point. What I have been working on, however, is
  understanding *why* they feel a certain way in particular.
* Become a **better listener**. I have been working on this for a while,
  but one area I would still like to improve is learning to ask the the right
  questions. I'm always impressed when someone follows up something I
  said with an engaging question, and I would love to gain that ability.
* Become more **well-spoken**. I'd like to be a better public speaker,
  both publicly and privately.
