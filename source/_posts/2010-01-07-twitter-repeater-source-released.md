Last night I finally released the [source to my twitter-repeater bot][1]. 
> twitter-repeater is a bot that automatically retweets any tweets in which its name is "mentioned" in. In order for a tweet to be retweeted, the bot account must be following the original user who tweeted it, that user must not be on the ignore list, and the tweet must pass some basic quality tests. 
> The idea was originally inspired by the [@SanMo][2] bot and was created so I could use something similar for [New London, CT (@NLCT)][3]

The bot is released under the MIT license and makes use of the [tweepy library.][4]
