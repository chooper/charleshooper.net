Two weeks ago I started a new job at [Truss](http://truss.works/) after
leaving Heroku two months ago.

Working at Heroku was an amazing experience in many ways. I achieved
the highest level of work-life balance so far in my life, I had great
coaches, and I solved a lot of challenging and interesting problems.

But it's time to move on so after a month and half of downtime I've
joined Truss as an operations engineer.

I joined Truss for a number of reasons:

1. I wanted to consult again; consultants are given more ownership of
 the problems they are tasked with solving and there's always something
 new to do

1. I believe there is a ton of opportunity for infrastructure consulting
 and engineering, both in government and in private industry

1. I wanted to work with the folks on this team in particlar

Thanks to all the folks who made my time at Heroku awesome and the folks who
have been most welcoming at Truss. I'm already enjoying working together!
