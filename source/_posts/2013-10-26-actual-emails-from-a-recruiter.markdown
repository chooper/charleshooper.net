OK, I was going to lead up to this carefully so this didn't seem like yet
another awful blog post about technical recruiters (can we seriously stop
posting those?) but I have no words. Here is the fifth email sent from one
particular recruiter inside of a week:

> Hey Charles,
> 
> I hope all is well man!  I hadn't heard back from you after my previous
> e-mail so I was toying around with putting together a search party to make
> sure you didn't fall into a well or something.  I'm not sure if that actually
> even happens anymore but this dog came up to me on my way to work and was
> barking at me in a way that seemed he was attempting to tell me something.
> 
> Naturally, I put two and two together and realized that perhaps I
> misunderstood my new furry friend and instead of saying "Chance is in danger"
> he said "Charles is in danger".  Which still doesn't shed light on the where
> abouts of my missing cat Chance, but if you are in fact in danger, don't
> hesitate to let me know.  I can hold my breath for 45 seconds (not that long)
> and I can run fast-ish for short distances.  I also have this thing with
> blood where I "pass out".
> 
> On second thought, if your in danger you should probably just call 911 or
> yell "fire" (I guess "help" doesn't work for some reason).  However, if
> you're even remotely interested in discussing the possibility of chatting
> about new opportunities, I'm your guy!  Hope to hear from you soon Charles!

Yuuuuup.
