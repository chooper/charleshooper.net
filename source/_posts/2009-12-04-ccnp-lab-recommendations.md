In the next couple of weeks or so I will begin studying for the CCNP (Cisco-Certified Network Professional). I have the study guides, but I don’t have a lab. My three questions:

1.  Will I need much lab time for the CCNP?
2.  If so, how intense are the labs?
3.  What type of equipment is recommended for a CCNP lab?

I passed the CCNA with almost no lab time at all, but to be fair I had worked for an ISP and was very familiar with alot of the material covered in the CCNA. I’m not sure that’s going to be the same with the CCNP. 
Thoughts? Advice?
