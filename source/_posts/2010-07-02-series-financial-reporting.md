This is the series [Intro to Financial Reporting][1]

At the date of publication, I was taking summer classes for Sociology and Principles of Finance. As part of the class, I was required to write a one page paper each week on a topic I chose. I chose Financial Reporting. At the end of the semester, these papers were concatenated and turned into one monstrous paper.Â [japherwocky][2] suggested post the papers to a blog, so here they are.
