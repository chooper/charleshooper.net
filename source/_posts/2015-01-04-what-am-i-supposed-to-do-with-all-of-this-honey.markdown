For Christmas this year, one of the wonderful gifts I received was this
two gallon bucket full of fresh, local honey. My friend, the gift giver,
offered the suggestion of brewing some mead which is too sweet for my
tastes. So what should I do with it then?

I thought I'd [brew some beer with it][1] but two gallons of pure honey (or
whatever that translates to in weight) is alot of honey and, since I'm
currently only doing one gallon batches of home brewed beer, it'll take take
quite a bit of homebrew to get through it all.

A quick [search for honey recipes][2] yields some interesting ideas as
well, with the top contender being these [sweet and sour glazed pork
chops][3].

So what do you think? What should I do with all this honey?
