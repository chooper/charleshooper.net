Twitter BookSuggest is a web app that attempts to make book recommendations based on a person's last 20 tweets. **Clicking** on a book cover will present you with a description of the book, as well as a clickable link to [Amazon.com][1] where you can purchase the book or add it to your wishlist. 
I've been working on this project for at the past couple of weeks, so please check it out. If you don't use Twitter then just hang tight, I'll be releasing a Facebook version shortly.
