Sorry for the RSS spam, everyone. I switched blogging platforms recently
from [Wordpress][1] to [Octopress][2]. When I updated my feed URL in
[Feedburner][3]; however, I'm told it re-posted all of my previous blog
posts in multiple RSS readers as unread. This resulted in a ton of
annoying spam for alot of people, particularly those using [Feedly][4]
and Google Reader.
