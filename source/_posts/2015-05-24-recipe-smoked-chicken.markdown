For Christmas, Erica got me a really awesome smoker which I've been
using at least every other week since then. She also got me the book
[Smoking Meat][1], which has one of my favorite chicken recipes.
It's so easy, that I often make two at once!

## Ingredients

To make the rub, you'll need the following:

* 2 Tbsp salt
* 2 Tbsp fresh ground pepper
* 2 Tbsp onion powder

And for the rest:

* A whole chicken
* Your favorite mustards
* Cherry wood (for the smoke)

## Instructions

Make the rub by mixing the salt, fresh ground peper, and onion powder. I
like to start with peppercorns and grind them down.

Now prep the chicken. At a minimum:

1. Remove the offal and fatty pieces from the cavity

1. Fold the fold the wing tips back so they don't get burnt

1. Loosen the skin

Now that the chicken is prepped, take the rub you made and rub it
*under* the skin of the chicken. Be sure to get the thighs, too.

Once you've finished with the rub, spread your favorite mustards all
over the outside of the chicken. Be liberal, because some of it will
cook off. Once you're done, truss the chicken (I just tie or pin the
legs together).

Now fire up the smoker! You'll want to stay between 200-250F degrees of
course.

Next, put the chicken on face down for one hour and then flip it. Then
cook the chicken for another three to three and a half hours and remove
when the internal temperature reaches 165F (measure the thickest part of
the thigh).

Now let the bird rest for ten minutes.
